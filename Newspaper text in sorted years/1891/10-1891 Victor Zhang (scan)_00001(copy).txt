thirteen miles
The train was made up of empty coal cars,
of a few loaded freight cars and a passenger

We found ourselves on the eastern arm of the

A DAY’S CRABBING ON SHARK RIVER.

E were a jolly crowd of twelve that started
out one bright July morning frdém an
Asbury Park hotel for a day’s crabbing on
Shark River. Starting early we arrived at the
end of our short journey at about ten o'clock,
where, after a great deal of talking and nothing
much accomplished, we succeeded in getting
four boats for the day. The outfit consisted
of a number of short lines, five or ten feet long,
with fishes’ heads tied to the ends for bait, acrab
net and a box for each boat in which to put the
crabs. After rowing for about two miles ai
to the other shore, we anchored in what seeme

Each person had two lines to attend to and so
we had six lines in our boat, which kept us very
busy. As soon as one crab was caught we
would go on to the next line and so on going
the rounds. We were having fine luck when

THE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION

For the first time in a number of years, ay
Athletic Association has been organized in the
school. Last year an attempt was made to form
an association, but it fell through All the ex.
penses of the foot-ball and base ball teams have
been met by subscription in the previous years
and last year the base ball team was fitted out
with uniforms, which, together with the other
necessities required for the team, cost in the
neighborhood of sixty. dollars. All this was
raised among the professors and scholars by
subscription.

The boys began to com plain last year because
there was so much money needed, that several
subscription lists were started.

This year the old members of the school de-
termined to organize, if possible, an Athletic As-
sociation, 30 that there would be some systematl
way of raising money, and so that there should
be some regulation in regard to the hall teams
and all athletic sports.

but we hope to show up admirably for all that.
The team plays well together, and they all go in

better work if we had a trainer—one who would

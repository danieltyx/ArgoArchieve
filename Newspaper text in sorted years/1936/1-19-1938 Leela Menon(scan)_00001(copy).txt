PREP WALLOPS NEWMAN SCHOOL 46-25
IN SCORING SPREE

Opening up in the first min-
utes of play, on a foul counter
by Jack Bartow, Rutgers Prep
went on to win the seconAé game
of the season in as many starts.

The Prep attack was cen-
tered around the mighty mite for-
ward, Joey Tretsky, who found the
mark from all angles of the court,

The score at the half saw
Prep ahead 20-12, with Tretsky
and Harper taking command of the
scoring, We really opened up in
the third period by making twen-
ty-one points, and went wild with
the one-hand shots of John,"Ivan
The Terrible" ,Kluey and the com-
bination cut-in shots of George
"Powerhouse" Burton, Bill "Slim"
Harper, and Jack "Dainty Gloves"
Bartow,

During the last frame the
entire reserve team replaced the
"Big Five". In this period Prep
saw that their own Joel "Pop"
Fertig had not lost his shooting
eye aS a result of the first game.

Scoring honors went to Joey
Tretsky, who rang up six field
goals and to John Kluey with four
field goals and three foul point-
eCrs.,

PREP QUINTET SUBDUES PREVIOUSLY
UNDEFEATED PENNINGTON

Kluey, Tretsky, and Burton lead
victors

Last Saturday afternoon the
Prep quintet journeyed to Pen-
nington for the annual game. Prep
was considered the underdog, and
after looking the court over it
was thought that there was no
chance for victory.

The game started out in the
usual fashion, but this time it
was Johnny Kluey who rang the bell
constantly through the first half.
The two teams sparred around the
court during the first half with
Prep holding the edge 21-14 at the
session.

The second half was a differ-
ent story, for the Pennington team
came to life and drew closer and
closer, until, with only a few
scant seconds remaining, they
surged ahead for the first time.
It was at this time that George
Burton came through with a lay-up
shot, to put the game on ice after

“Number Five _

CRODNQUIST GETS ONLY SINGLE FIRST
AS PREP LOSES FIRST MEET

Last week-end our swimmers
opened their winter campaign
against Pingry in the Elizabeth
pool. The mect started with the
40 yd. freestyle won by our op-
ponents, but by dint of a swell
sprint, George Wilmot was able
to take sccond place. The next
race, the 100 yd. breast stroke,
was a push-over for our long,
lanky military boy Paul Croon-
quist. From then on until the
relays, Pingry had the edge. But
in the medley it was a different
story, Pingry was pushed all the
way and won by only a short 4is-
tance. We took the four man free-
style relay in a speedy manner to
end the mect.

Tho Rutgers Prep basketball
tean of 1920 must have been 4
groat team. They were City
Champs that year, but even that
does not account for there being
two pictures of them on the wall
of the hall leading to the asscri-
bly roon, They certainly must
have been super men to rate so
much of the valuable space.

Last week it scoms that Joc
"Blondaic" Miller was a partner in
a "Brower" pun. During the third
period English class, Joc was
reading a sentence so mixed up
with bolts of lightning ané balls
of fire that one could make no
head nor tail of it. After Jos-
eph had finished reading his scn-
tence Mr. Brewer said, very
spontaniously, "You had better
read that sentence again, you
have ne "all ballod up".

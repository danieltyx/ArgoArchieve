and the Confederates. The results
showed the Student Benefit slate
to have swept the election, as
all four of their candidates were
put in office.

Fred Sherzer, a senior and
Student Benefit candidate for the
presidency of the Council, de-
feated his rival for the post,
senior Jim Lamont, by a count of
h1 votes to 38 in one of the clos-
est races ever held at Prep.

Clark White, the running mate
of Sherzer, amassed enough bal-
lots to beat his opposite on the
Confederate ticket, Jim Weisfeld.
Likewise, Joan Devine was elec-
ted, 0-38, to the secretaryship
in a red-hot race against Joyce
Kenneally. In the last balloting,
Alan Black was voted into the
treasurership over Alice Weisfeld.

The voting for president of
the Council was held separately
from that for the other three of-
fices. The candidates for the
latter posts were put on the same

here. The two rival parties, the Str
dent Benefit Party and the Con-
federates, or Rebels, each gave
their supporters a good deal to
cheer about in the form of acts,
platforms, and, of course, serious
speeches on the part of the can-
didates,.

On Wednesday morning, Prepsters
opened their desks to find post
cards naming the Student Benefit
slate and giving a poem concern=
ing it.

The following day, the Confed-
erates issued posters in the same
manner. These stated the Rebel
platform and named the Rebel can-=
didates. From that time on, many
of these posters, as well as many
of those of the Student Benefit
Party, were visible in every room
of the school building.

Thursday marked the first day
of speeches by the candidates.
Joan Devine and Alan Black, Bene-
fit hopefuls for the posts of se-
cretary and treasurer, were in-

GOOD GOVERNMENT—

We have just finished what is
undoubtedly one of the pest elec-
tions ever to be held at our
school. Each one of us voted for
his or her favorite candidate for
a variety of reasons - platform,
abilities, or just plain person~
ality. But now that the Student
Council officers have been chosen
wetve all got just one desire
left, and that is to have as good
a student government as possible.

Let's start out by helping the
winners in every way we can. As
the saying goes, "If you can't
peat ‘em, join 'em." Neither the
Student Council nor the student
body can get anything done with-
out the other's cooperation, so
let's make unity our first goal.

Secondly, the Council can't do
anything unless the school first
shows that they want it done. No-
body on the Council, regardless
of who he is, will be apt to sit
around trying to think of good
deeds to do for the school. Ac-

 

' gests.

tually, somebody from the

body must be the person ae
gest changes. Of course the Couns
cil will, of their ow accord,
try their best to unravel all
school .difficulties which the
know about, but in order to get t
true picture of school sentiment
it must have suggestions offered
by students outside of its om
ranks. A suggestion box, as well
as meetings called to hear Prep-
sters air their views,should take
care of this matter.

Thirdly, it is up to the stu-
dent body to carry through any
projects, such as dances or beach
parties, which the Council sug-
So the responsibility a-
gain comes to rest on the shoulder
of each Prepster; we, ourselves,
mist take it up, and with the aid
and leadership of the Council,
make our school one that is truly
"of the people, by the people,and
for the people."

THE ARGO OCTOBER 8, 1951

INQUIRING
REPORTER

To start off another year of
investigating Prepsters' various
views, the Inquiring Reporter of
THE ARGO asked this question,'What
extra-curricular activities would
you like to see at Prep?" of ten
of our scholars. The reactions

differ, of course, but all ox-
press sound ideas.

The answers received by our

sleuth in search of opinions were
as follows:

BOYS

Phil Cohen, Junior:"I would like

to have only a basketball
team,"

Frank Saloky, Senior: "Basketball"

Bill Cramer, Senior: "Thumbs down
on Phys. Ed."

Robert Grace, Junior: "Swimming."
GIRLS

Joan Devine, Junior: "If we do
have anything I wuld prefer

to have basketball and also
swimming."

Elfriede Riddering, Sophomore:"I
would like to have hockey,

swimming, and also tennis,
if possible."

Pat McGovern, Sophomore:"Swinming
and basketball."

Carmen Watson, Senior: "I think
we should have swimming and
badminton,"

Joyce Tuckey, Senior: "Lots of
swimming."

Molly Parkham, Freshman: "I would
like to have swimming."

Rumors are flying that a cer-

bit of gas making trips to Mill-

Hey Danny, I'm sure there are
plenty of girls at Prep who'd
like to ride in your station wa-
gon. You don't have to go all the
way to St. Peters for them. That
goes for you too, Fred!

It has been noticed that J.
Taylor is quite a gentleman when
it comes to picking up erasers.
Right, Mr. Blake?

Why does our P.G. man with the
George white sweater always turn
his head to the left when sit -

Who is this mysterious T.F.S.

What is it in the second row
that seems to have caught Mr. To-

Harold, did you or didn't you
ask J.D.?

How does the young man who sits
in the third seat in the third
row rate those two blondes who

sat next to him at a local foot-
ball game?

Dudley, who were you winking
at in English class? Or was that
just a cinder in your eye?

Photo-offset printing is in-
deed new to the Prep school, put,
on the other hand, printing it-
self is not. As late as 19:7, THE
ARGO was a printed paper. In the
next year, however, the publica-
tion unfortunately was discontin-
ued through lack of interest.

In 1949, the present series
of ARGOs began when a junior named
Walter Quinn rejuvenated it, but
Quinn was compelled by lack of
funds to mimeograph it. The paper
continued in this form until the
present issue.

It is mainly through the ef-
forts of Mr. Coyle, faculty ad-
visor of THE ARGO,of Mr. Gaggini,
faculty advisor of the YE DIAL,
and of Fred Sherzer and Jim La-
mont that the money to pay for
printing was raised. The adver-
tising section, unable to cover
the cost entirely, was aided ma-
terially by a contribution by Mr.
Shepard from the student activi-
ties fund of the school.

EXTRA RC URKRICULAR

ACTIVI TI

Several new extra-curricular
activities are now being consid-
ered by the faculty and may soon
appear in the school curriculum.

Foremost among these at the
present time is a dramatics so-
ciety. This will include, in ad-
dition to the presentation of
standard plays to audiences of
parents, the production of radio
plays during assembly period. An
idea which has been advanced is
that such plays be recorded in
the afternoon and then be played
pack during assembly. In this
matter, we may thank George Van
Vechten for putting his recording
and amplifying equipment at the
disposal of the school.

Another possibility is the
formation of a theater club.Four

years ago, such a club was suc-
cessfully organized, and it at-
tended, as a group, several top-

notch Broadway productions. A bus
hired by the club transported
them directly to the theater in

ballot, and then the votes for
each office wre counted separate-
ly. This allowed those students
who desired to leave after the

first election to do so.

Although the elections for of-
ficers of the Council had now
been held, other voting for regu-
ler seats on the Council board
occurred somewhat later, during
the next week. (See Pg. 7)

New York City and afterwards back
to New Brunswick.

It has been suggosted that
Princeton's McCarter Theater might
be substituted for the Broadway
houses. In this way, tho cost per
person could be cut almost in half

for the bus.

A third project under consid-
eration is the organizing of a
debating society. This might take
the form of a group which would
represent Prep in debates with o-
ther schools; on the other hand,
however, it might very possibly
provide a basis for intra-mural
debates during assembly period.

by Szuch's counterpart among the
Rebs, Jack Taylor. At the close
of the speeches of these "southern
belles," they bombarded the audi-
ence with candy kisses.

On Friday, the last day of the
campaign, the study hall was fes-
tooned with balloons bearing the
names of the Benefit candidates
and also Benefit slogans. All
through the day,Confederate flags
were to be seen flying from var-
ious desks.

The Rebel hopeful for the vice
presidency, Jim Weisfeld, spoke
first, telling of the plans of
his party for a good administra-
tion. Then Jim Lamont, the South-
ern presidential nominee, oex-
plained each point in the Confed-
erate platform. (Cont. on pg. 7)

ranking high in scholastic work,
Fred devotes mech of his time to
extra-curricular activities. Having
been on the basketball team for
three years, he is now one of the
top varsity players. His journa-~
listic talent has been proved by
his two years' work on the staff
of THE ARGO and YE DIAL, as well
as his reporting of school and
sporting activities for the Home
Nows. Fred's additional interests
include singing in the Glee Club,
and playing football and baseball.

‘Ye Dial’ Editor
Plans Improved
Book For °54,

With the election of this year’s “Ye
Dial” staff, hard work was immediately
started to make the yearbook an even
better publication. John Kuhlthau, edi-
tor of the yearbook, and his staff made
it clear during an assembly of the entire
school that SUPPORT of this project by
the student body is essential.

Stan Bey, the business manager of “Ye
Dial” announced a new policy for get-
ting adds. He told the school that this
policy would leave the actual size of
the yearbook dependent upon each per-
son's Own energy and initiative.

Extra attractions which would make
the yearbook better are the increased
number of pages which will only be
obtainable through the support of the
student body. The familiar phrase, “Go
out and get more adds!” will not be
harped upon as in past years. according
to promises from the staff.

The staff feels it is very easy for every-
one to obtain adds. This promise of the
staff stems from the fact that they were
able to secure three hundred dollars
worth of advertisements on one Satur-
day morning alone.

The group has gotten off to a fine
start with John Kuhlthau at its head,
and Joe Becker, Malcolm Cohen, Diane
Dorn, Steve Hancox, Norm Karshmer,
Jonathan Margolis, Tono Rebollo and
Clementina Vitti.

The staff will have completed the first
twenty-four pages by December first,
which will include the title page, faculty
page and all material on the senior
class.

Prepster’s Culture Vultures
Plan Opera Trip to N. Y. C.

Students of Rutgers Prep may have]

an oportunity to attend a performance
of Puccini’s opera “La Boheme” some
time this spring. This proposed trip was
the idea of Mr. Dumarae, who in con-
junction with John Kuhlthau and his
party thinks it is an excellent way to
develop appreciation of the arts among
students. They feel definitely that this
trip will be of benefit to the school.

The trip will be of interest mainly to
those students who would sincerely like
to see an opera and who think they
might enjoy it. Mr. Dumarae, in describ-
ing his plan, said, “I feel that this trip
will be both educational and enjoyable
to the students of Rutgers Prep.” John
Kuhlthau added that most students of
the school would find the perfonmance
of an opera an unusual and interesting
event.

 

Rustic Theme To Lead
In Fall Dance Planning

   

Gari Gatwood, Dance Committee
Chairman

 

Mr. Heinlein Attends

e
Education Conference

On Friday, November 13, Mr. Hein-
lein attended the convention of the New
Jersey Education Association which is
held each year at Atlantic City, The
members of the association are those
teachers, school headmasters aud prin-
cipals who teach in this area.

Mr. Heinlein’s main reason for attend-
ing this conference was that ne might
go to a discussion on better relationships
between high schools and colleges. The
purpose of this meeting was to find out
why students who are academically ca-
pable of work on the college level often
go to college and then fail in many of
‘their classes.

In order to investigate this problem
more thoroughly during the present
school year, there will be representatives
from other schools and colleges who
will visit our school in order to observe
our academic program. Also members
of our faculty will visit other schools and
will make similar observations.

It is hoped that as a result Vf the
meeting and the visits to other schools
which have been planned, our school
will become acquainted with each other’s
problems and that the change from sec-
ondary school to college will be made
less difficult for students, and will ease
the problems of adjustment for the
college student.

On the trips that faculty memvers will
make to the other schools, they expect
to discuss the problems of the prep and
high school graduates in colleges.

 

Len Bartlett Contacts Band
For Informal Turkey Trot

The Rutgers Prep fall dance will be
held on November 2 at the N. J. C.
lodge. The date was announced by John
Kuhlthau during assembly on November
12. His announcement ended a long aud
somewhat confused discussion among
the students, who had not been able to
agree on a Suitable date.

' Gari Gatwood, head of the dance com-
mittee, has asked the following people
to assist him in planning the dance: John
Kuhlthau, Elfriede Riddering, Pat Lan-
caster, Kathe Van Vechten, and John
Flanagan,

Asked about his decorating plans, Gari
mentioned first a “cleaning up” project.
Lots of scrubbing, window washing, and
dusting will be the first job to be done.
Gari indicated some anxiety about this
part of his plan.

He and his committee have chosen a
rustic theme of decoration, They hope
to make excellent use of big birch logs,
fall flowers, hunting equipment, and rus-
tie furniture. Soft fall colors and fire-
light will transform the lodge into a
wonderful background for the dance,
they feel.

A good band of a piano, drums, saxa-
phone, and a bass fiddle is being pro-
vided. Gari and his committee are mak-
ing sure that for this dance the band
hired will be willing to play any type
of music. The band, too, is going to be
an asset in leading various group ac-
tivities and helping people to enjoy sing-
ing and games, as well as dancing.

 

Student Council Will Revise
Constitution Under Edelberg

On November sixth, the Student Coun-
cil held its first complete session of
the year with John Kuhlthau presiding.
The new members who have been elec-
ted by the various classes are: Don
Hughes and Tono Rebollo, the senior
representatives; Clifford Griggs, from
the junior class; Diane Dorne and Clem-
entina Vitti, who are sophomores; Steve
Hancox, representing the freshmen; and
Arthur Karshmer of the eighth grade.

At the meeting several points of in-
terest to the school were brought up.
The ammendment to the constitution
was spoken of by Stuart Edelberg, and
he was appointed by the president to
bring the former constitution before the
next meeting with plans for revision.

SENIOR ATTITUDE

On my recent election to the presi-
dency of the Senior Class, I was asked
to write this editorial. To me the presi-
dency means the representation of the
class as a whole and thus it certainly
should be considered a great honor.
I should try to emulate the ideal student,
as all Prepsters should.

This year means not only taking an
interest in the scholastic aspect of the
school but all the various functions
which add enjoyment to our regular
school work.

This year offers a great opportunity
for all to be active in school life, na-
mely the activity period, During this
alloted time we are given the chance
to contribute our worth to the different
organizations. I consider this period
given to us a great privilege.

In the past Student Council campaign,
the winning party promised a Senior
Day. It definitely will prove an asset
to the serious minded students. On this
day we are given the opportunity to
instruct one of our classes. If we go
through this day with the proper attitude,
perhaps the custom may become a tra-
dition at the Prep.

I am going to try to make this year
a most successful one, both for myself
and the rest of the Senior Class. The |
other class presidents should try to do|
the same. In my opinion, this can only
happen through a well acquainted class,
and the desire for harmony,

Letters to the Editor

In the past weeks we have taken a
few tests to test our skills in the fields
of English and mathematics.

I personally think that these tests are
very good in helping a student find his
weak points in these fields, They not
only show how much you know but
where your weak points are so that the
faculty can help you along so that these
weak points will no longer exist in our
scuvol, Lt the students take the tests
in their stride, they will not have to
worry about their weak points, and
also it will bring up our standing in
the minds of the faculty.

Alan Chirgwin

Dear Editor:
School isn’t the only thing that’s a

duul grind this year. The pencil sharpen- J

ers in this school take the prize for the
dullest grind this side of the Raritan
River. An unsuspecting soul sticks his
pencil in, cranks the handle a few times,
and pulls out a splintered mass that
was formerly a pencil. Another type of
shanpener(?) could better be called a
pencil duller, No matter how long one
cranks, one still ends up with a broken
point. Room One is completely devoid
of a sharpener of any kind. During one
of Mr. Dumarae’s essay tests it is neces-
sary to have four or five wel] sharpened
pencils on hand or else end up chewing
a point on the worn pencil, May we
please have some decent sharpeners?

“Grouchy.”

Dear Editor:

I was recently reading an issue of last
year’s “Argo” and have decided that I’d
like to compliment the present staff on
the good job it is doing to improve it.
Realizing that nearly everyone concern-
ed is new to the routine of putting out
a printed paper, I think the school
should be proud of the result so far. It
will be a pleasure next year to find the
Rutgers Prep “Argo” a member of the
Columbia Scholastic Press Association;
and the present publications group

should be proud to be pioneering to-
wards that goal.

John Kuhlthau is
familiar students seen around Prep. He
has had a hand in all the ‘activities in
school and is one of the few people who
can be five or six places at once, doing
a Hoven different things and succeeding
in all.

John, also called “Mr. President,” is
a good politician. He was elected presi-
dent of the student council this fall
after a vigorous and well planned cam-
paign. Since then he has been busily
putting spark into the organization,
which, with Elfriede Riddering as dance
chainman, put on its first dance, which
was a big hit.

As editor of our yearbook, the “Ye
Dial”, John has proved a wonderful
worker. He has enlarged the book and
promises more interesting articles-

Another extra-curricular activity John
indulges in is singing in the Glee Club.
He sings loud and true with the bass
section and was a soloist in last year’s
Spring Concert. i

Also a sports enthusiast, he has enter-
ed into all sports at Prep. As a freshman
he played football. This year he parti-
cipates in basketball, track and was
elected captain of the soccer team.

In spite of all these activities, Jon
still finds time to keep up in scho®
work, ranking high on the honor roll

SPORTLIGHT

NORMAN KARSHMER

Soccer is a thing of the past and
basketball is the sport of the present.
In this column of “Sportlight,” I would
yike to make a few predictions and
comment on some of the better ball
players in school.

This year’s team is big, fast, and
accurate.

at about six feet four inches or over.
On the speed side we have Bill Kurtz,
who played basket ball at Hoffman
High of South Amboy. Bill is fast, can
jump, and can sink almost any shot:

George Kalli is another fast man on|:

the team who can shoot with either
hand. Last but not least of the probable
starters is Al Murasco of South River.

Al made All-County from South River |.

High School and is one of the best
teenage basketball players in the state.

Here are some predictions of my own
that may seem funny to the rest of the
school:

Somebody will beat Lou Borbely’s in-
dividual scoring record of thirty-five
points in one game.

Somebody will come close or top 447
points in one season. This is the school
record and is held ‘by Lou Borbely.

One of the boys on the team will
make All-County and probably All-
State.

If we win three of our first five
games we will have a .750 season or
better-

Rutgers Football Star Gives
Views On Soccer At Prep

Q: What do you think of soccer at
Rutgers Prep in comparison to foot-
ball?

A: In the past three years the foot-
ball potential has decreased with the
coming of the girls, eighth grade and
the loss of the boarding school at Prep.
Because of this, soccer has done a
magnificent job in keeping a fall sport
at Rutgers Prep.

Q: Did your football, played at Rut-
ce Prep, help you in collegiate foot-

?

A: Yes, football at Prep helped me
considerably in collegiate football since
I received the fundemental training
needed for football, especially with the
small squads at Prep, where teamwork
was much closer.

Q: What do you think of football
and the one platoon system?

A: The one platoon system makes the

Trophy and Letters
Awarded to Booters

On Friday, November 6, Coach OQ’
Connell awarded thirteen varsity letters
to members of the 1953 soccer team,
which wound up with a 2-3-2 record.

Before awarding letters, Coach O’Con-
nell praised the fine spirit of the team
and their hustle in producing a good
record, considering their lack of ex-
perience. He also praised the high
scholastic average of the team members.

The letter winners included all of the
starting line-up aling with two subs
who played a fine game. Stu Edelberg,
the leading scorer on the team, re-
ceived the first letter. Bernie Cohn,
a fine offensive and defensive wing,
came next. John “The Toe” Kuhlthau,
our center halfback came next., followed

Successful

Second Soceer Season

Rutgers Prep has just finished its sec-
ond season of soccer with two wins,
three losses, and two ties, This was quite
a successful season, considering that the
majority of our first string were playing
soccer for the first time, and that we
‘went into many of the games as the
underdog.

A great deal of the success :nust be
‘eredited to the coach, Mr. O’Connell, It
was because of his coaching in the skills
of the game, and his patience, when all
the players pulled “boners.” He seemed
to know just how much praise vr criti-
‘cism would bring out the best in each
member of the team.

The first string players and the sub-

stitutes gave their time by faithfully
reporting to practice. By thorough prac-
tice, the team learned to work as a team
Should, as well as to develop their in-
dividual skills, which added a great deal
to the success of our second season. The
team also had a great deal wi: spirit.
They went into each game, no matter
how good the opposing team was, with
the idea of winning, and not giving up
till the very end.
| Since soccer was introduced to Prep
last year as a substitute for football, the
first year proved to be much more diffi-
cult than this year, for then our players,
with a few exceptions, knew very little
about the game. However, this year all
but a few of the players had iearned
something about the game by watching
or playing the year before.
. A player that cannot escape mention
is our captain for the year, John Kuhl-
thau. This is John’s second year of soc-
cer, and his “big foot” proved to be a
great asset to the team, assuring both
seasons,

Other outstanding players this year
were: Stu Edelberg, our high scorer, who
scored eight goals and set the record for
the school; Bernie Cohn, who played a
great game on the wing, and by his able
assistance brought our team to victory;
and last but not least, Al Murasco, who
saved many a good kick from going into
the goal.

All the credit can’t go to Mr. O’Con-
nell or the team, for the Prepsters them-
selves, who came out and cheered the
team on to victory or near victory, had
much to do with the success of the sea-
son. When the students came out to cheer
them on, the team played much better
than they did when there was a small
turnout.

Activities Flourish At
Elementary School

This year we are striving to improve
both the upper schdol “and lower school
as much as’ possible. The Elementary
School faculty agrees that the vest way
to do this is by having more activities
in which both students and teachers can
work together.

On October 29th, there was a Hallow-
een party given at the gym. Punch and
doughnuts were enjoyed by all. Games
were played, and Mark Levine, Bernan
Hartley and Frank Pirozzi wou prizes
for the best costumes, All this helped
to make the new students as much at
home as those who have been at Ele-
mentary since the beginning of their
schooling,

The choral group, which meets each
Wednesday under the direction of Mrs.
Margaret Kelly, is said to consist of
some very fine voices. Some of the chil-
dren may be splendid future prospects
for our own Prep Glee Club.

On the second floor of the school, there
is a room set aside for a laboratory.

children bring in small animals
such as the two white rats brought in
by Sarah Hearn, which have become the
center of attraction to all. Most of the
children seem to have a great interest
in the books and specimens in the lab-
oratory.

By having more activity for the chil-
dren, which is being done this year and
from now on, each and every child
should get more fun and pleasure out
of being educated. .

Daily Conference Periods
Correct Student Difficulties

As you all know, there is a conference
period four times a week. This confer-
ence period is for the student’s own ben-
efit. If he fails one or more courses, he
has to remain after school for this pe-
riod until he shows an improvement in
the mind of the teacher whose course he
has failed. In previous years if someone
failed a subject, he had to Temain for
the complete marking period which was
not quite fair because some students
did show a great improvement in their
studies.

In a talk with Mr. Heinlein about the
achievment tests which the school has
taken, he stated, “These tests which we
have taken will expose weakitesses in
reading, grammar, spelling and mathe-
matics. Our idea is that if we know the
weakness of students in certain subjects,
we can help those who are failing. The
conference period is to find out about
study habits; and if they are poor, we
a seve the student on correct study

The ARGO
Honor Roll Cited

At the close of the first marking pe-
riod, eighteen students qualified for the
honor roll. They were Franklin Preiser,
Diane Dorn and Carl Stover, all of whose
marks were 90 or over. Also on the honor
roll were Louise Di Lalo, Charles Duna-
enko, Stuart Edelberg, Richard John-
son,; Gerard Kamm, Michael Kessler,
John Kuhlthau, Barbara Lipman, Joseph
Messina, Tono Rebollo, Richard Schwartz,
Rogér Seamion, Kathe Van Vechten, Mar-
ian ‘Veale and Howard Tobin. .

all but one “subject, and they tuerefore
received ~‘honérable mention: Joseph
Becker, Malcolm Cohen, John Flanagan,
Rolfé Harrison, John Hohol, George
Kalli, Pat Lancaster, Jonathan Margolis,
Sharon Ries and Carl Zolna.

When Mr. Heinlein presented the news
of the first honor roll, he congratulated
those who were on it, The Headmaster
also said that he wasn’t pleased with the
small size of the group, and he hoped
that the size of the honor roll would be
greatly increased by the next marking
period. :

Many different types of skirts have
been worn this year. Barbara Lipman’s
red felt with black poodles at the bottom,
Marcia Owen's gray poodle cloth,, deco-
rated with her many different belts, and
Susan Lang’s plaid one with a blanket
fringe at the bottom are among the most
stylish.

The vests and weskits worn by Gail
Duschock are very attractive and add
style to her skirts and blouses.

The most popular type of shoes, this
year, are saddles and white bucks. Loaf-,
ers are also very popular,

Sweaters, as usual, remain a tavorite
with the girls at Rutgers Prep, Nylon
and orlon sweaters seem to be the most
popular, with cashmere, wool and angora

are the traditional cardigans and pull-

Enthusiastic Turn-

Out Attends Dance

The combination masquerade party and
dance held at the Rutgers Prep gym on
October 31, was a fine success owing to
the cooperation of both the students and
the decorating committee.

The decorating committee, with Mrs,
Wilson as faculty adviser and Elfriede
Riddering as student director, did a fine
job of transforming the gym into a Hal.
loween spectacle. The gym was bedecked
with alternating orange and black crepe
paper stripes extending from the center
of the ceiling to the walls. The entrance
revealed a small enclosure covered in
black crepe paper.

The dance was attended by fify cou-
ples and a few more boys who came stag,
The high point of the evening came
when Mr. O’Connell led the party in a
few group ‘songs. Also highlighting the
dance was a short “bunny hop” and an
excellent ‘rendition of the Charleston
given by Gloria Gatwood and Marian
Veale. ’
Though no prizes were awarded for
costumes, the general consensus is that
the most original was John Kuhlthau,
who masqueraded in a pair of pajamas
and a bathrobe. The most decorative was.
Bill Muhs as a Chinaman. Two of the
prettiest were Clementina Vitta as an old
style country girl, and Marica Owens as
the Queen of Hearts. One of te most -
unusual was Marian Veale, who posed
as a 1920 pin-up girl.

Faculty who attended the dance were
Mr. and Mrs. Heinlein, Mr. O’Connell,
and Miss Kelly, Mrs. Wilson and Mr.
Holley.

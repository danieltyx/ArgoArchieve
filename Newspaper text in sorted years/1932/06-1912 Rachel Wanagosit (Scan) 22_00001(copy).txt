RECAST AND FORETROSPECT.
sf the class of 1912 1s
so amazing with its multitudinous and varie-
gated complexity of details that it would be
practically impossible to delineate it properly
in the space at our disposal. Therefore our
readers will have to satisfy their insatiable
cravings for rejuvenating memories with a few
anecdotes, etc., relating to our illustrious ca-

The previous history «

reer in R. P. S.

One night in June, 1932, I was peacefully
reading and smoking in my chair, when I
heard steps on the floor outside. I called
“Come in,” and then jumped nearly three feet
from my chair. There stood a shadowy, trans-
lucent being, like nothing I had ever seen be-
fore.

I don’t believe in ghosts or Prof. James, but
I almost changed my mind then. As I looked
I saw in the countenance of this form, one
after another, the faces of my old classmates.

“Who are you?” I gasped.

“T am the spirit of R. P. 12,” replied the
shade in a composite voice. “Come.”

“Where?” I said, rising and taking my hat,
as though compelled by the presence.

“Twenty years ago to-day you graduated.
Have you ever thought where your friends are
now? I will show you.”

We left the house, and immediately were
walking down Broadway, New York. We en-
tered a theatre in which was playing, so the
signs read, “The Man All In,” starred by
“Titus Bugs.” The spirit without hesitation
led me ‘round to the sacred region behind the
scenes. There in the star’s dressing room sat
Titus, the famous light opera tenor, none other
than our own beloved Ley, the best tenor in
New York, and we actually had despised his
talents when he let them loose in those hal-
lowed halls, twenty years before.

gut the spirit hastened me away, and soon
I found myself in White Plains, walking down
Main street. Soon I saw a barber shop, and
was guided in by the spirit.
familiar faces.

There were two
I looked closer and beheld

ers.”

Farley and Stroh, the best barbers White
Plains had ever known. The latter, I learned,
had learned the trade from Dever.

Once more the scene changed, and I stood
inside a church. At the pulpit stood Wells,
preaching, and effervescing with redundant
multisyllabic words, expressing his thoughts
inadequately, as of old.

The service being nearly over, we waited.
Soon the deacons passed the plates, and as one
of them came near me I nearly fainted. It
was “Booze.” When the service was over I
shook hands with my old classmates and ex-
pressed wonder at their stations. They told
me they had been brought into religion by
Watts. I asked to see him, and immediately
the spirit whisked me off to the Ethical Cul-
ture School.

There in a study hall was Watts, A.B.,
A.M., Ph.D., solemnly preserving order.
Awed by the sight, I tiptoed away, and again
the scene changed.

This time it was a little country village, but
swarming with people, for was not a circus to
perform that day? Making our way to the
main tent I saw glaring posters of “Will &
Wall, Famous Athletes and Prairie Dog Tam-
Entering the tent, we began to look at
the animals. Hearing footsteps, I looked up
and beheld our old friends Dunnie and Bill
Brainard, none other than the “Will & Wall”
on the poster.

Next we came to the office of a great met-
ropolitan newspaper. There in the artists’ sec-
tion I saw a face that did my heart good. It
was Giles Low, happy as ever, drawing car-
toons for the paper of Ordway, and his own
hasty exit from class when our sophomore
president.

As we crossed the street, coming out, [
tripped and nearly fell into a ditch. A muf-
fled oath came from below, and looking down
T saw a gang of swarthy Italians, marshalled
by a burly American. When he turned to face
me T saw that he was Zeitz, I greeted him,
but that was all T could do, for the spirit an-

nounced that we must hasten if I were to see
the rest of the class,

Then passed before eye ; saat
of stranger events, and their incongruity dazec
me, I saw, ina hotel, Reeves. chief bartender,
calmly mixing cocktails for Ritter, who looked
wan, worn and pale, and he explained that he
was married, hence his state of dejection.

L saw a railroad, and then a train crawled
by at about 2% miles an hour. (The spirit
told me I was in Cuba.) Leaning out of the
cab, his figure tense with the terrible speed,
one hand on the throttle, the other on the air-
brake, hung Marquez, senior engineer of the
road.

As often before, the scene chartged before
I could speak. We were in a vast stadium.
The Olympic games were proceeding. There
was a stirring all around me. Then I saw the
cause. Down the track swept forty men. It
was the 100 metre dash. Suddenly two figures
sprang forth ahead of the throng. Straining
to pass each other, they crossed the finish line
neck and neck, in the remarkable time of 15
flat. As they passed me on the way to the
dressing room I recognized them with a start.
They were Voorhees and Van Middlesworth,
of the famous R. P. track team. Shouting a
greeting, I was whisked away again.

There were but two men left to see, Succop
and Elmendorf, of the foot-ball, basket-ball
and base-ball teams.

We came to a placé which, by the clouds of
smoke around, I recognized as Pittsburgh.
There, in his native city, was Succop, huskier
than ever, driving a coal wagon. TI rode with
him a way, until we came to the ball park of
the Pirates. Bidding farewell to “Scubby” we
entered. There on thé mound stood Elmen-
dorf, pitching his finest curves, while the
Giants came to the bat steadily and pounded
out long drives, incidentally winning the pen-

nant. The game over, we went out with the
crowd.

spirit. “Twenty years from to-day I will ¢, sie

Suddenly a pain shot through me

cigar, fallen from my mouth while | slept, Was
lying in my lap, and I had awakened because,

He seized her, drew her to him, and delib-

Again and yet again, the brute repeated the
blow and still she gave no sign of suffering,
but when with rapidly growing anger, he

aloud—and her head flew off. She was only

AS THE CURTAIN RISES.

The Acropolis: Your paper is by far the
most complete, in all its departments, on our
exchange list. Your cuts are very good ; also
your stories are well written.

The Orange (White Plains H. S.): Your
athletic department is very weak and also
your exchange column. This is something
needed by all papers.

The Pivot (Central H. S.): Your paper is
very good and your staff seems to be com!
posed of hustlers. Cuts, jokes and stories are
all found in good profusion, although your
jokes seem somewhat scattered. Good luck
to you. :

The Magpie (DeWitt Clinton H. S.): You
have a very good paper, but it could be in-
proved by the separation of jokes from adver-
tising matter.

The Wizard (Ossining H. S.): You are
always welcome. Your paper is extremely
neat.

The Packers Current Items: Glad to have
you on our exchange list. You could im-
prove your paper with a few longer stories;
your stories however are well written.

The Hilltop (Jersey City H. S.) : You have
a fine literary department and your school
notes are good. But why don’t you have a
“Joke column”?

The Spectator (Trenton H. S.): Your lit-
erary department is good, your athletic de-
partment shows up well, and we are glad to
have you on our exchange list.

Vail-Deane Budget (Elizabeth, N. J.) : You
are a very neat paper. You have a well edit-

ARGO

ed athletic column and your stories are good.
On the whole, you are worthy of much praise,

The Chronicle (Peddie Institute, Hights-
town, N. J.): You have an excellent cover,
Your stories are clever. Also you are well
illustrated and your arrangement of depart-
ments is very good.

X (cellentidea ), (Bellefonte, Pa.): You
have a good athletic column and you have
plenty of good stories, but your Exchange col-
umn is decidedly weak.

BEFORE THE FOOTLIGHTS,

The School Notes surely do not amply
cover all the activities of the school.—Boys’
High School Record,

The exchange editors of The Argo seem to
have waked up to the fact that their position
on the editorial staff is no cinch. We would
not advise publishing so many extracts from
other school papers. The majority of these
contain very adverse criticisms and the space
could easily be taken with your own comments
on other papers. This may mean more work
than copying the opinions of others, but it
would raise the value of your paper in the es-
timation of your exchanges.—The Academy
Spectator.

Your exchange editor must work dread-
fully hard, arranging your wonderful ex-
change list in alphabetical order, and copying
the names for the Arco. He should make the
acquaintance of the athletic editor and get him
to tell his secret of success.—Valkyrie.

STRAW VOTE

Under the auspices of THE

held Oct. 8, in which Wendell L

 

Willkie was an overwhelming victor
by a majority of two to one. Willkie
received fifty-seven votes against
President Roosevelt's twenty-six
Twelve votes were cast in favor
of the Communist candidate, Earl
Browder, while Norman Thomas,
the Socialist candidate, received four
ballots. In the opinion of the fac-

RECITAL WITH CLARA RACKMAN ON THEREMIN

The Rutgers Concert Series for 1940
opened with Paul Robeson, the noted
Negro singer, as the first performer.
Mr. Robeson is a graduate of Rutgers
University and has a law degree from
Columbia. While in college he was
one of the greatest football players
America has ever had and was also
a Phi Beta Kappa man

When the cast for the famous pro-
duction “Showboat” was being chosen,
Mr. Robeson obtained one of the most
important parts and was immediately
acclaimed by the critics. Up to this
time he had never sung except for his
own enjoyment, but noticed that when
he did, everyone listened in awed
silence, and so he was persuaded, rather
against his will, to try concert sing-
He did so, and from then on his

 

 

ing.
fame as a concert singer increased
steadily,

The program opened with a series

 

of five folk songs and spirituals, such

as “Go down, Moses.” To the wild

| applause which greeted him at the end

of these selections the singer very kind-
ly gave a number of encores,

Miss Clara Rackman then gave an
exhibition of her skill on the theremin.
This peculiar instrument was described
on the program “an electrical in-
strument which is not touched by the
hands in playing. The player is in
troduced into an electro-magnetic field
developed about the instrument, and
by manipulation of the hands creates
the tone of the instrument, which
sounds rather like a viola. The very
difficult. technique of mastering pitch
has been well solved by Miss Rack-
man, who has, almost sle-handed.
transformed a scientific gadget into a
recognized musical instrument.”

as

sir

 

For the third part of the program
Mr. Robeson sang the “Ballad for
Americans,” ably supported by the

Rutgers Glee Club.

The theremin, while an exceedingly
clever mechanical device, seemed slight
ly out of place at a musical recital. It
also seemed that the simple pieces
chosen by Mr. Robeson did not com-

pletely show up the wonderful quality
! and tone of his voice.

There are thirty-eight classes in ses
sion this year, which has made it neces-
sary to hold one class in the elementary
school building and another class in
one of the college buildings. In place
of Mr. Brewer, the former English
master, Mr. Davis M. Simpson, who has
an A.B. and an A.M. from the Uni-
versity of South Carolina as well as
a MSM. (master of sacred music)
from the Union Theological Seminary,
has joined the teaching staff. Previous
to this year, Mr. Simpson had been
teaching at the Kamehameha Boarding

 

schi in Honolulu, T.H. Mr. Simp-
son has already stimulated the student
body's interest in group singing Every

Wednesday morning for forty-five
minutes, he leads the students in group
singing. The school is building its own
song book whick h will include folk songs,
college and popular songs. The
increased eureiiment of the school has
made it necessary to appoint an addi-
tional teacher to the staff. Mr. Ben

YOUR SCHOOL

It has been stated many times that Rutgers Prep is the student's
school, It does not belong to the headmaster or the teachers, but it
belongs to you, the student. The headmaster and the teachers are
paid for the supervision of the school; they run it but they do not own
it. The school belongs to the student, and it is what the students do
that gives the school a good or bad reputation.

A brilliant scholar carries the reputation of a school far. People
look back to find out where this outstanding man was educated, and
in this way the school benefits. If students of a preparatory school
continually make good marks in college, the university will accept
more boys from this school, and will be more likely to recommend
them when they write for references to employers. ‘In this way, the
credit finally comes back to the preparatory school where the boy
received the base of his education.

Although strong athletic teams do not necessarily increase the
reputation of a school, sportsmanship both on the field and on the
sidelines is an important factor. Good sportsmanship carries the
character of one school to another and promotes hard clean athletic
rivalry. Although you not on the field, be a good sport at all
times whether home or away.

By all means, take good care of the school’s property. By damag-
ing these things you are only hurting yourself, for these things have
been provided for your use.

These are the most important ways in which you can help your
school and at all times keep them in mind whether in the classroom
or on the football field.

LIVING IN A COLLEGE TOWN

Jn one of Moliere’s pla

ys there is a famous anecdote about a stupid
{ Jourdain, who finds out in middle age that
he has been speaking prose all his life without knowing it, and is highly
delighted with the idea of doing something literary. The position of
the average student in a college town is a rather sim one, since he
is continually surrounded by opportunities for self-improvement of
which he, for the most part, appears sublimely unaware. This is not
true in a small rural community, but in a large centre like New Bruns-
wick th is little excuse for overlooking these chances. A few rep
resentative examples of these may be briefly described.

The most important of these advantages probably is the general
atmosphere which surrounds the college town. Its effects are two-
fold, since it stimulates in different ways both the pupils of the school
and the masters. In the former the incentive to work is greatly mag-
nified by the proximity of the Rutgers campus, since when college
life is merely across the road, it is far more vivid to us than when it
is a hundred miles away.

To go from the abstract to the specific, the town's libraries hold
out great possibilities to the inquiring student. They are well stocked
and could be utilized to a greater extent than they are at present.
Newell Dwight Hillis, in his “Contagion of Cha er,” says that in
the same way that twenty minutes physical exercise each day will
keep up the muscles once they have been developed, so will half an
hour's daily reading develop the mind

Another important opportunity for self-development is to be found
in the Rutgers Concert series, which is given each year under the spon-
sorship of the University.

In “Pilgrim’s Progress” by Jolin Bunyan there is a character
called “The Man with the Muck Rake,” who spends his whole time
raking up all the dirt underneath his feet, and does not even notice |

the band of heavenly angels playing overhead. A word to the wise—. |

Many prominent political big-wigs
have been yelling about the fact that
the country has been in a rut since
1929, Perhaps we have been, but on
the examination of a list of a few things
that we have accomplished during that
period, we feel that the country should
in in this rut. Since 1929 we have

transoceanic air service, fluorescent

say, were counted before Willkie re-

Recent figures issued by the De-
partment of Commerce, show the na-
tion's payroll has increased by $100,-
000,000 over last year. The increase
is due largely to the production and
sale of Willkie buttons.

Winners Tally All Points
In First Half; Take
Defense in Second

Stopped cold by a powerful running
attack, punctuated by trick plays and
occasional passes, Rutgers Prep went
down to an 18 to 0 defeat in its first
game at the hands of Morristown
Academy, Friday, Oct. 4. The winners
kept all their scoring in the first half
and managed to stave off a second halt
visitors’ rally to win.

Bob Elseasser was the big gun for
the winners, scoring one of the three
tallies made and doing the major share
of the offensive work. For the Rutgers
eleven, Mathew Hahn starred offen-
sively, while Neal Herron stood out
as the finest defensive player.

George Hurley started the home team
off in the first period when he re-
turned a Prep punt to the Rutgers 33

 

yard line. A line buck went for 2
yards, and then Hurley carried on a
double reverse for a jirst on the

21 yard line. Eleasser sliced off tackle

for 6 yards more, and then left end
Bill Leonard took the ball on an
end-around for the first score.

The second quarter opened with
Elseasser tossing a long pass from
his own 30 and advancing the ball

to the Prep 19 yard line, as right end
Aspenwall caught it on the 40 and
ran the rest. After a line buck went
for 2 yards, Elseasser went wide around
end for the score.

Elseasser reversed to Hurley in the
final minutes of the first half, and the
latter carried over from the 9 yard line
for the Final touchdown.

Prep Wins, 13-0

 

Rutgers Prep defeated the Carteret
School Football team, at the new Car
teret field in West Orange, Oct. 11,
1940, when they rolled two touchdowns
in the second and fourth periods, prov-
ing themselves a well coached squad.

Early in the first quarter, Bill Evans
intercepted a Carteret pass on their
jorty yard line and returned it to the
thirty-two from where they drove down
| to the twelve but lost the ball on

downs. Later in the period, J. Miller
| recovered a fumble on the thirty-eight

and sparked by the Hahn-to-Spratford
passing combination, drove to the two
| yard Ine where Dave Rust fumbled
on a line plunge.

Prep Scores in Second Quarter

In the second frame, the Prepsters,
taking the ball on their own thirty,
| started a march of seventy yards for a

touchdown, using a series of well exe
| cuted plays, with John Hackett going
| over from the two yard line on a re-

verse. Matty Hahn kicked the ball

| between the uprights for the extra
point

Spratford Scores Second Touchdown

Straight football with Hahn and Rust
doing most of the ball carrying, carried
the Prepsters to the home team’s 42
yard stripe early in the last period. A

forward, double lateral play, with Hahn,
Walt Spratford and Hackett handling
the pigskin, advanced the ball to the
20. From this place Hahn threw a
beautiful pass to Spratford deep in the
end zone for the second tally. The
conversion was wide, and the Maroon
won 13-0, for the first win of the
season,

Coach Petke’s squad proved them-
selves a dangerous aerial offensive
team, completing 7 out of 10 attempted
passes.

proved the wisdom of the English de-
partment in giving them, As a result
of the examinations, the staff is able
to have a fast and slow group in Eng
lish I and English IIL In English
IV there are two literature sections and
two grammar sections.

There have been several improve
ments in the school plant this year
A new roof adorns the prep school

building. New Chemistry and Physics
equipment and History maps have been
acquired for the school. English Lit-
erature books will be rented out this
year instead of being sold to the stu-
dents, After a few years, these books
will be paid for, and the school will
have a library. Mr. Stearns should
get a pat on the back for this clever
plan. On the whole, the school build-
ing did not need many improvements
because of the complete modernization
last year. Several improvements were
made on the dormitories. The stu-
dents’ rooms were refurnished, and the
faculty rooms were repaired,

This year in the field of sports,
new sport will be adopted for the
interest of the student body. Mr.
Stearns will coach a crew next spring,

the help of the Eastman School first
organized this splendid orchestra, To-
gether with the orchestra will be in-
troduced Miss Iturbi, the attractive sis-
ter of the conductor. Miss Iturbi will
accompany the orchestra in playing
a Mozart concerto on this occasion

Song,” Lotte Lehmann and the out-
standing Wagnerian tenor, Lauritz

Melchior will present some works from
their Wagnerian repertoire. Both solos
and duets will constitute the program
Mme Lehmann being equally success-
ful as a concert and opera singer will

 

 

surely guarantee a splendid perform-
ance

The last of the attractions in the
Concert Series will be the appearance
of the world's outstanding symphonic
organization, the Boston Symphony
Orchestra. With the superb quality
of the orchestra the inspired inter-
pretations of its conductor, Serge
Koussevitzky, the concert is sure to

be a huge success.

he created and so did not expose them
in the end of the story. Instead he
substituted a somewhat weak ending
which was rather an anti-climax for so

World's End

also,

is a story of the
First World War period and after-
ward, through the Peace Conference,
giving a graphic description of the
times under the guise of fiction

fhe main hero of the story is a
charming young boy named Lanny
Budd, who is about thirteen years old
at the beginning of the book. He is
studying dancing at Hellevau, and
loving it intensely. It is here that
he meets his two best friends—an Eng-
lish boy, named Rick, and a German
named Kurt Meissner. After leaving
Hellevau he goes home to southern
France for the season, and there,
among other things, visits a slum un-
known to his folks, with Jesse Black-
less, a radical, who was chosen to be
Upton Sinclair's mouthpiece for the
story It is here, too, that we meet
Robbie and Beauty, Lanny’s parents.
Robbie is an American munitions
maker, while Beauty is an irresponsible
flapper for whom the reader feels sym-
pathy none the less.
hat winter Lanny made a visit to
the Castle Stubendorf in Germany,
where Kurt lived. This gave him a
good idea of the German way of life
whieh proved useful to him later on
From there he travelled all around io
Europe—now to the Mediterranean
now to England, visiting Rick. At
about that time the world war broke
out, bringing a gr deal of business
and intrigue to Robbie who was in
keen competition with the munitions
makers of all other countries and like
them, believed that he had the right
to sell arms to any nation, regardless
of on what side it was fighting. Robbie
was constantly trying to make Lanny
realize that war was merely a matter
of big business, chiefly munitions, and
that the cleverest man wins. Through
him the boy came to learn much about
the secret dealings of governments and
to famous and powerful
men ntime he lived a peace-
ful and contented life on the Riviera
which he adored, trying to hold him-
self aloof from the war, as his father
wished but feeling it around him all
the time,

The clima:
taking part the Pe Conference
as a secretary to Professor Alston, a
member of the American Commission,
where he watches Wilson's plans for
world peace drearily come to nothing,
and meets some of the great men who
took part in that dram: After the
failure of the conference he became
involved in a Socialist plot from which
he emerged a wiser, if not sadder man
and at the end everything turned out
all right. Although it drags out to-
wards the end, it is still very interest-
ing and one of the year's best books,

The Argo Adopts New Format,

Five Columns, Newsprint Used

With this issue, The Argo
operates as a five column, news-
print paper. The old form of The
Argo was a four column paper
printed on a glossy-surfaced
paper.

The change in format , and
paper gives the paper's staff more
freedom of space in which to work,
more variation in layout, less ex-
penditure per photo or cartoon,
and more room for expanded
coverage of feature columns and
articles,

Hopes High

The staff of the Argo, led by
Editor Levine and faculty ad-
visor, Mr. Michael L. Lasser, are
pleased with the change in the
paper. They feel that the old
form of the paper did not utilize
fully The Argo's potentialities.

The administration of the

Faculty Gives Opinions

Mf transition, it Is only natural
that The Argo move with it, The
changes the staff has made
should provide students with op-
portunities to do more writing
and to gain a more intimate
knowledge of journalistic prac-
tices.”

Mr. Holly adds encouragement,
ices

   

However, Dr. Heinlein believes
that, while we have more room
for experimentation, only the
quality of the staff determines the

school and the faculty feel that

quality of the paper.
History of Change
The history of The Argo has
been one of change in its 71
years of existance. Talking to Mr.
Sperduto, whose delving into Prep

standards and study habits.

Student Orientation

Dr. Heinlein and the rest of
the faculty have since organized
September 12 and 13 for new
students, They are taught how
to study, school regulations from
the Student Handbook, and are
shown activities and clubs they
may join.

New students have always been
vague on regulations and have
had difficulty learning proper
study habits, Now, since we have
this orientation, the new fresh-
men and others coming to Prep
will be ready for work along with

Prep has certainly changed in

it was the wrong building! The
school’s facilities and appearance
have been changed because of
the recommendations of the

New desks have been installed

All Rooms Improved

Looking around the rest of the
school we can see that almost
every room has new lighting
fixtures. The whole school, with
the exception of Mrs. Wilson's
and Mr, Lasser’s rooms, has been
painted. Each room has new
desks, both for the students and
teachers.

On the second floor the old
publications room has been re-
modeled and is being used as a
classroom. Both an Advanced
Math and an Algebra class will
be held there.

Administration Takes Heed

Most of these improvements
were suggested by the evaluation
committee which visited Prep last
year. Upon learning of its
recommendations, the Board
of Administration took the
initiative in bringing about all of
these improvements.

A student returning to Rutgers Preparatory School this
year is immediately confronted with the atmosphere of
change which prevails throughout the building. It is ex-
tremely difficult to believe that this is the same school we

In Welcoming Students, Dr. Heinlein Urges A Closer
Examination And Analysis Of Our Changing World

by David M. Heinlein

Each year the editors of the|™
Argo extend to me the privilege
of welcoming you: pupils who are
new to our ‘school, as well as
those of you who are returning.
I always like to remind you that
the history of our school has
paralleled the origin and develop-
ment of our country. How fortu-
nate we are to be a part of both!
Our heritage gives us direction.

The literature of the past tells
us that men with fine minds were
speculating in higher mathe-
matics, astronomy, technology,
medicine, law and religion. Five

I have always been impressed
by the persistence men have had
as they overcame the many
obstacles which rose between them
and their contribution to human
experience and knowledge. Only

you to acquire the fundamentals
upon which you can build your
future thoughts.

‘This year Prep welcomes three
new teachers to the faculty.
‘They are Mr. David Lloyd, who
will teach English IV; Mr. Robert
Fenstermaker, who will teach a
new physics course; and Mr.
James Davidson, who will teach
Plane Geometry and Algebra I.

These new teachers will
strengthen the faculty and help
the students in improved systems
of learning. For example, the 7th
and 8th grade math courses and
the 9th grade algebra will follow
the Yale School Math Study
Program.

Besides these teachers, we wel-
come many new students. One
new Senior will join us, as well
as 5 Juniors, 3 Sophomores, and
16 new freshmen. The freshmen
class, consisting of about 55 pu-
pils will be a gain over last
year’s 42.

Mr. Davidson, a mathematics
major at Yale University, Class
of 1960, will instruct in Algebra,
Plane Geometry, and Analytic
Geometry and Calculus.

This course is given to fresh-
men in college. Mr. Davidson will
assist Mr. Blake and Mrs. Wilker-
son.

Mr. Lloyd is a graduate of Yale
University who entered the Navy
as an officer. This summer he at-
tended Middlebury College to
study creative writing. Mr. Lloyd
will teach English I and English

323 Students Attend
Third Summer Session

This summer, Rutgers Prepara-
tory School conducted its third
summer school, and again it
proved highly successful. The
students represented a majority
of the schools in this area.

The summer session, which
lasted from June 27 until August
5, had 323 students in attend-
ance. Each day there were three
periods, each lasting two hours.

Many subjects were taught
during the session, English was
taught by Mrs. Wilson, Mrs.
Bornheimer, and Mr. Lasser; Mr.
Holly, Mr. Blake, Mr, Cromack,
Mr. Boronio, and Mr, Davidson
taught Mathematics. Mr. Du-
merae, Mr, Gaggini, and Mrs.
Bornheimer taught foreign lan-
guages, and history was offered
by Mr. Sperduto.

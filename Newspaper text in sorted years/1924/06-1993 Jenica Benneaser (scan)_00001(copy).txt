FACULTY SKETCHES
Mr. Cook
Mr. Cook, the school’s math ee
was born at High Falls, N. ¥. In 190
he entered New Paltz Normal School,
where he took a classical course for four
years. After this he became principal of
a school in Barryville, N. Y., and later
taught at Lake Mohegan for a year. It
was now that he entered Rutgers College,
and also began to teach at the school. At
that time Mr. Scudder, who had been
principle of the normal school where Mr.
Cook had studied, was headmaster here.
At college Mr. Cook got his letter in his
freshman year, and became captain of the
gym team at the end of his sophomore
year. After leaving here in 1910 he went
to Columbia, where he studied mathe-
matics under David E. Smith, one of the
best mathematicians of that time. After
one year at Columbia, he married Mrs.
Cook and returned here to teach. He has
remained at Rutgers Prep ever since, ex-
i for 1922 which he spent on a farm
at home,

Co., Publishers, for three years, It was
at the end of this period, in 1930-31, that
he entered upon his career of teaching in
Rutgers Prep. In 1929 he had married
Mrs. Thatcher in St. Louis. He went
abroad again in 1931, and since then has
been teaching here.

Mr. Brown

Our Physics and Chemistry teacher,
Mr. Brown, was born in Whiting, Vt.,
at the turn of the century. After attend-
ing high school at Brandon, Vt., he en-
tered New Hampshire University, where
he spent four full years preparing for
medicine. Later he proceeded to the Uni-
versity of Michigan where he performed
graduate work. In 1926 he entered Leay-
enworth Institute in New York State,
where he worked till the fall of 1928.
Then it was that Mr. Brown began his
teaching at Prep, which has continued till
now.

Mr. Stroud ‘<

Mr. Durant Stroud, our French and
Spanish teacher, was born October 16,
1904. Mr. Stroud graduated from Wil-
mington High School in 1923, and entered
the University of Delaware, from which
he graduated in 1927 with a B.A. degree.
In the summer of the same year Mr.
Stroud attended the Spanish class at
Middlebury College, and in the summer
of 1925 attended the University de Nancy
and the University of Paris.

When Mr. Stroud returned to the
United States, he taught at the Perkiomen
and Hill Schools before coming to Rut-
gers Prep.

On February third of this year, Mr.
Stroud married Natalie Chadwick at Wil-
mington, Delaware, and thus the “Trap
family” is augmented by. still another
member who has proved a most congema
and welcome addition.

Mr. Laramore

Our Latin teacher, Mr. Julius B ton
c ao ’
Laramore, comes from Washing

ennett
June, 1933

Georgia. He received his early education
at the Robert E. Lee Institute and at
Staunton Military Academy. After grad-
uating from the latter, Mr. Laramore
proceeded to the University of Georgia,
and two years later entered the Univer-
sity of Chicago, where he received his
B.A. degree in 1925. This, however, did
not complete Mr. Laramore’s studies, for
in the summer of 1928 he went to the
University of Southern California for
graduate work. In 1927 he came to Rut-

gers Prep.

All the boys at the Trap, and those of
the day students who study Latin know
of Mr. Laramore’s trip to Europe and
the Near East last year. Accompanied by
his mother, he visited eleven countries, the
Island of Rhodes, and the Riviera. The
countries which interested him most were
Austria, Italy, Egypt, Palestine, Turkey,
and Greece. In the course of his trip
Mr. Laramore obtained with a vest pocket
Kodak many unusual photographs, which
have made splendid enlargements.

Thus ends our attempt to give a brief
sketch of Mr. Laramore, arch-rival of

grouchiness and gloom.

Mr. Hartman

Mr. Robert Nelson Hartman was born.
at Golden, Colorado, in 1902. In 1925
he received his B.A. degree at Susque-
hanna University, and in 1927 attended
the Rockne-Maxwell Coaching School.
While at Susquehanna University Mr.
Hartman received three letters in varsity
football and two letters in varsity bas-

ketball.

When he came to Rutgers Prep in
1930, Mr. Hartman took an immense load
upon his shoulders, for besides teaching
English, Algebra, and Biology and assist-
ing in the coaching of varsity football,
he was given the task of coaching midget
basketball and baseball. However, he has
obtained good results, and good athletes
as well as good students have been trained

under his supervision.

errr

THE ARGO Page Three

At present Mr. Hartman is completing
the work for his Master of Arts degree
at Bucknell University, where he studied
during the past few summers. We all
certainly hope that he gets it in high
standing. We may even call him “Prof.”
Hartman in a few years. He is one of
the most popular and best-liked teachers
ever at Prep.

Dr. McGinn

Doctor Donald J. McGinn, our English
teacher, spent the early years of his life
at Indian Lake, New York. Entering
Cornell University in 1922, he began a
pre-medical course from which he later
transferred to liberal arts and majored in
economics and English. In 1926, after
leaving Cornell with his A.B. degree, he
worked in the commercial department of
the New York Telephone Co. until Feb-
ruary, 1928. Then he returned to Cornell
for graduate work, and studied Eliza-
bethan English under Doctor J. Q.
Adams, now director of research at the
Folger Shakespeare Library in Washing-
ton, and Professor Lane Cooper, a prom-
inent alumnus of the school. In 1929,
after securing his Master’s degree, he con-
tinued his work with the two scholars
mentioned, and also studied philosophy
under Professor G. W. Cunningham. Dr.
McGinn was awarded his Doctor’s degree
in 1930. Since he was an outstanding
miler in college, while doing his graduate
work he was assistant coach of track,
specializing in distance running. After at-
taining his Doctor’s degree he came here.

Mr. Roehler

We now wish to acquaint the boys with
Mr. Herbert Roehler, who was born near
Breslau, Germany, in 1909. From 1918
to 1924 he studied in the Cologne Gym-
nasium. During the war his father was
killed, and in 1924 Mr. Roehler left Ger-
many to come to America. Here, in New
Brunswick, he went through both junior

Kilmer’s Message to id vie Prepara-

To the students of Rutgers “P ‘l

” School Joyce Kilmer always wi

tion. In the field of literature he as
most renowned graduate of the old sc ee
In token of his esteem for his sage :
has dedicated to it Alma Mater, whic
ranks among his best verses. Although
many years have passed since Kilmer sat
in the old schoolhouse, his spirit still
lingers in its halls.

Kilmer was born in 1886 in New
Brunswick, received his early education
at Rutgers Preparatory School, and after-
ward entered Rutgers College, from
which he graduated with honors. He then
attended Columbia for four years and
not long after his graduation was given
a position on the New York Times. Dur-
ing his years on the newspaper he found
time to publish three volumes of poetry—
Suiumer and Love, Trees and Other
Poems, and Main § trect and Other
Poems. From the outbreak of the war he
took an active interest in the cause of the
Allies ; and when America entered the war
in 1917, he was among the first to volun-
teer. In August, 1918, while reconnoiter-

On the field with a ghostly Cricket-bat b
the stream with a ghostly rod: ay
They will touch the hearts of the livin
with a flame that sanctifies, 8
A flame that they took with strong Young
hands from the altar-fires of God,
—from The New School.

 

When Joyce Kilmer wrote The New
School, the last two stanzas Of which are
quoted above ,he did not dream that in
a few short years he would be one of
these “noble dead’? whose names were tg
be inscribed in bronze upon the chapel
wall. He did not know that his name
should “through the centuries in grateful
prayer be said.” But Kilmer did die on
the field of battle red with the blood of
millions of other young men who were
fighting in the war to make the world
safe for democracy—the war to end war.
This poem which he has left behind him
should serve the purpose for which he
intended it—to convince the youth of the
“new school,” not only here at Rutgers
but all over the world, of the utter futility
of war. Indeed, it is to the youth of the
entire world that the poem is directed.
They are the New School; they are the
future citizens and rulers of nations; and
unless they heed the poet’s mesage, they
are the future cannon fodder of wars yet
to come.

These wars that may come will be more
terrible if the young people of the world
do not demand that international peace be
maintained regardless of what material
sacrifices may be involved. War is a
futile and horribly destructive way to
settle disputes. When a war is ended and
millions of lives have been sacrificed, to
Say nothing of the more millions maimed
and disabled, the belligerent nations find
that the conflict was in vain—nothing has
been settled: on the contrary, the feeling
of rancor and hatred has heen increased.
Kilmer saw the cruelty of war—this mul-

PARTING WORDS: A MESSAGE

FROM THE HEADMASTER

I had a call recently from one of our
graduates who told me that his year spent
in Rutgers Prep was the happiest year
of his life. It was sandwiched between
four years in a splendid New Jersey high
school and four years in Princeton, that
great university. You know it’s not the
bread that gives the sandwich its name,
but the filler in between. So far as he
is concerned, and he was a Cum Laude
and bright enough to judge, was educated
on a Rutgers Prep sandwich so to speak.

I am still trying to think what there
was about our little school that gives it
such a place in his affections.

In the first place, it was unexpected.
No one here had deliberately set out by
propaganda or wiles to charm him. He
came about his daily work just as you do,
and we did just as you see us doing now.
After all the strongest influence is that

THE ARGO

Page Nine

of which no one is conscious of wielding.
It could not have been the building. He
did not even have the novelty of living
at the Trap, but lived with his family in
town. There was nothing impressive about
the school house compared with the ele-
gant city buildings of the high school or
the great university. There was no super-
iority in our courses of instruction nor
the scholarship of our teachers. It would
be nonsense to set ourselves above such
institutions in those respects.

I can attribute it only to the spirit of
human friendliness and the willingness
of each and all to give the best that is in
him to our common life. If I am right,
and that is true, we ought to carry away
from this school a lesson that can be ap-
plied wherever we are and as long as we
live. If every Rutgers Prep man can be
distinguished by this spirit as he walks
among his fellowmen, what greater fame
could any school desire!

No doubt every school puts some sort
of an impress on its boys. During school
days the whole group take on certain
characteristics — and —conversely they
drop off certain others. Their language in
and out of school generally shows what
changes are going on in their minds; so
does their behavior toward parents, to-
ward social friends, on the playing fields
and in the schoolrooms. If the spirit here
helps boys upward, they will feel the
same glow of pleasure that an athletic
victory or a high examination or any other
success produces. They will always asso-
ciate Rutgers Prep with happy days.

We are all human, just trying to get
the most out of life as we go along. But
just as it is in trade and commerce, so
it is with us here. There must be give
and take, there must be exchange or there
can be no profit. The teachers you most
admire are those who are giving you
something, and the best boys are those
who are giving most in return. Let that

in athletics, and in extra-curricular actiyi-
ties. In studies the school offers the
chance to certify -for almost any college
outside of the three requiring College
Board Exams, namely, Harvard, Yale anq
Princeton. Yet for even these three ¢ol-
leges Rutgers Prep is a stepping stone,
for the College Board requirements are
fully covered in the course of a school
year. At the present time the school has
graduates in such leading colleges of the
East as Princeton, Cornell, Penn, Dart-
mouth and Rutgers. Even as far west as
the University of California is its influ-
ence felt. In athletics the school has of-
fered chances for the boys to display their
abilities on the gridiron, the diamond, the
cinders, the tennis court, the basketball
court, the swimming pool and the golf
course. Here they not only enjoy that
satisfaction that comes through competi-
tion supplied by neighboring schools but
develope a sense of sportsmanship and
fair play that is an asset to any man. To

the school has the privilege of using Rut-
gers University equipment which is an
opportunity that is not overlooked.

Our teams this past year have been of
the highest caliber both in competition and
in sportsmanship; as proof of this, con-
sider our championship teams in basket-
ball, football and swimming and our 1
dividual champions in swimming and
track. As a result Rutgers Prep is more
than a name, it is a symbol. In extra-
curricular activities the Glee Club and
quartette offer an outlet for those musi
allyy inclined; indeed several, of the a
dents have availed themselves of the Pf Ivi-
lege. Then through the medium of THe
Arco, always open to student contribu-
tions, every boy has a chance to tY a
hand at journalism. In addition to a
above activities there is always the ae

scholastic and athletic training is also the
scene of many social activities,

Most of the fellows here have grasped
these opportunities as they came along.
As a result the school has had one of the
most successful years that have been re-
corded in its history. For these reasons
it can be readily seen that the preparation
received here for college and later life
covers every imaginable field, mental and
jtysical endeavor. If anyone of you have
everlooked the chance to make use of
these opportunities as they presented
themselves, he has indeed missed some
of the spirit of Rutgers Prep.

THE CHOICE OF A COLLEGE

In the spring of each year, when the
time of graduation approaches, many
thousands of students all over the country
are wondering what they will do when
they are through with their secondary
education. In preparatory institutions,
nine-tenths of the graduating class will
enter college at the beginning of the next
school year.

Assuming that the student has definitely
decided to go to college, he must find an
institution suited to his personality, and
also fitted to train him thoroughly for
his life work. This choice of a college
is not easy, for there are so many excel-
lent schools in the country, but by the
time of graduation, the boy usually knows
what he intends to become when he fin-
ishes college, and therefore he must select
one which will equip him with the neces-
sary factors for his life.

If the student is preparing for a pro-
fession he should investigate thoroughly
the outstanding schools concerned with
the profession he has chosen. There are
many fine private colleges to be investi-
gated: the large state universities offer
excellent training in almost any field.
Prospective engineers would do well to
inquire about the various technical col-

THE ARGO

Page Eleven

leges. Those students who intend to spec-
ialize in liberal arts departments will find
their choice more difficult because all the
colleges, large and small; have courses in
the liberal arts. In the same manner the
men who are preparing for other walks
of life will proceed in finding a suitable
institution.

Also to be taken into consideration by
the prospective college student is the
choice of a university with a small select
student body, or with a large composite
and, incidentally, a democratic group of
students. The problem of choosing a coed-
ucational school is also to be decided. The
boy will find that he will be more im-
portant in a small college, but it is ques-
tionable whether this is an advantage. In
a large college he will learn to look out
for himself and to depend on his own
efforts to succeed, whereas in a small col-
lege he will be more or less of an individ-
ual.

Taking all these as well as many other
factors into consideration the student can
pick a college with a reasonable amount
of assurance that when he becomes a
member of the institution he will find it:
adequate for him in all respects.

—Robert Howard.

THE ARGO STAFF
THE Arco was very fortunate this year
in having such an efficient editor-in-chief
as Francis Pattberg who has given a great
amount of his time in order that the
Arco might go to press, and who has
written many good editorials
Another very able member of the staff
is Bob Howard, associate editor, who has
contributed especially good articles.
Frank Beardslee has written several in-
teresting articles on events of school life,
as has also Franklin Brost. Ralph Faulk-
ingham has kept the student body in touch
with the achievements of the swimming
team, and Russel Gindin with the schol-

SEA, SOUND AND SKY

Two open shells meet before me in an
undulating line of green and gray, ex-
tending far as the eye can see. I, a spot
in the vastness of the sea and sky, sit
stunned on the mind’s diameter of the
ma estic half-circle. Grimly, angrily, the
endless waves toss themselves to my
sandy haven. Here, there, over the whole
expanse, they grow, race in fury toward
the shore, and break there in a white rage
of useless endeavor. The crisp breeze
lashes, goads, and derides the water in its
helpless surging,

Caught by the startling blue of a patch
of sky that softens the hard green sea,
I look on to watch the clouds. Hurry,
hurry, the whole world moves while I
recline. The damp, grey clouds bustle
half-heartedly before the nipping wind,
their slavish taskmaster. Like the school-
boy running home, they soar across the
sky. They separate and mark themselves
off by rivulets and lakes of infinite, deep
blue. From place to place the sun beams
radiate like searchlights through inter-

of light dance in sliding lines on the
rough, green, billowing carpet.

Lonely, bare of man-made signs,
gigantic as nature itself, the huge spaces

titude of slaughtered and wrecked, to-
gether with the untold needless expendi-
ture of wealth—and he tried to use his
poetic genius to persuade the coming gen-
eration to keep peace with their foreign
neighbors. He knew young people; he
knew their impetuosity. He remembered
from his school days “the halls that were
loud with merry tread of young and care-
less feet.” Most of all, he realized that
unless these young people force their gov-
ernments to keep peace, peace never will

be kept.

Th people of America today, fifteen
years after Kilmer’s death, are beginning
to see the importance of world peace. Af-
ter twelve years of slothful inactivity, or
at best, half-hearted attempts at interna-
tional cooperation, the nation has entered
forcefully into the plans for disarmament.
Practical suggestions are being presented
by the American government to the for-
eign nations for the purpose of definitely
and securely outlawing war. Whether or
not the influence of Kilmer and the other
poets is felt by all nations today, it is
difficult to conjecture, but it certainly is
felt by the capable, far-seeing man at the
head of our government. Although Kil-
mer’s dream of peace has not yet been
realized, let the youth of today listen to
the ghosts of the Old School who will
touch their hearts with a “flame that sanc-
tifies, a flame that they took with strong,
young hands from the altar-fires of God.”

THE ART OF DOING WITHOUT
THINGS

Considered from the point of view of
finance there are three groups of individ-
uals in this world; namely, rich, middle
class, and poor. The rich are usually in
a position to have any material thing that
they desire. The middle class are able

 

ARGO Page Thirteen
to live comfortably, but must do without
some things which are above their in-
comes. The poor are really the ones who
must excel in the art of doing without
things. A person’s income therefore is
the damper which controls his possession
of luxuries.

Usually people who are chronically
poor have adapted themselves to a life
devoid of luxuries. By constant -subjec-
tion to poverty, the average person will
generally minimize his expense to an un-
believable degree, merely enough to keep
life within his body. Knowing that his
money is limited, and knowing that his
very existence is dependent on his absten-
tion from certain luxuries, he learns to
live with a minimum of expense.

An example of how environment can
affect a person’s ability to get along with-
out things is shown in the fraternities of
our colleges. A boy may join a fraternity
and be surrounded by living conditions
often much better than he has at home.
He lives here for three or four years in
comparative luxury; he is then thrown
out into the world, and in probability has
to start working at fifteen or twenty dol-
lars a week. After having been used to
high living conditions, this sudden drop
forces him to reduce his budget greatly
and to accustom himself to lower living
conditions. Does his fraternity life help
him when he enters the world? Assuredly
not. The boy who scrapes along on very
little money in college and learns to go
without many things will be much better
prepared to launch forth into the business

world.

Modern living, of course, with its cars,
radios, and labor saving gadgets, encour-
ages people to spend money in order to
live a bit more comfortably. If, on the
other hand they were to exercise a little
restraint and go without such trifles, they
probably would be much better off in

Cairo, Egypt, July 18.

We were passing into the harbor of
Alexandria when I awakened and came
on deck at five o'clock this morning. In
the actual approach there was nothing
save the flatness of the landscape and a
fleeting pang of mal du pays to remind us
that we were about to see the land of the
Pharoahs. But on entering the docks
there was no longer any illusion as to
Oriental atmosphere. Forming a seem-
ingly endless line leading to the gang-
plank were so-called porters, wrangling
unintelligibly among themselves, some-
times fighting for position, and controlled
with whips by Egyptian police in imposing
uniforms, while in the streets beyond we
could see the colorful if unhurried move-
ment of native life beginning another day.

There was a long delay as we pro-
gressed through the tedious formalities of
customs and Passport examination, and
the sun was hot as we disembarked and
rode through the handsome

with that of European countries we had
visited, engaged our attention, especially
in the fields, where primitive methods of
plowing and threshing are stil] employed,
and at the crowded railway stations,
where the cries of many venders of water
and breads contributed to the prevailing
bedlam. Occasionally along the route we
saw an automobile, but traffic consisted
for the most part of heavily burdened
donkeys. A majority of the natives
walked, but camels provided a statelier
mode of transportation for the more

and women wear long robes with gaily
colored jackets, and the latter are further
encumbered with veils partially or com-
pletely covering their faces: and many of
them carry huge earthern jars of water
or baskets filled with food or clothing bal-
anced perilously on their heads. In addi-
tion to Damanhour, the largest town on
our route, we passed a number of peculiar
mud villages, and occasionally in isolated

heat which sweeps from the Sahara as

into bygone centuries. The road through
the two miles of desert leading directly
to the Pyramids is too rough for motor

been possible amid the squalor within the

Bethlehem and entered the Church of the

and many everburning lamps is a star,
which according to tradition marks the
birthplace of Christ. The original stalls
are many feet below the present church,
but the pilgrim may descend a narrow
stairway to an ancient cave, which might
well have served as a stable. So solemn

all combining with the subdued glow s

The afternoon we passed in wandering
about the Grand Bazaar, where one
prushes shoulders with every nationality
on earth bargaining for rugs, for brass-
ware, for Oriental embroideries, for semi-
precious stones,—for all the wealth of the
East, it seemed, spread in bewildering ar-
ray through fourteen miles of narrow
covered streets redolent with the conglom-
erate odors of food, leather, donkeys, and
humans.

More kaleidoscopic than Cairo, more
cosmopolitan than Paris, Constantinople
is indeed a rendezvous of the East and
the West. Over Galata Bridge, connect-
ing the old quarter with the new, passes
an ever-changing, heterogeneous proces-
sion of humanity and of vehicular contri-

Have you ever thought of the dangers .

of living just for “things?” Has it ever
occurred to you that “things are only the
little joys in life? Or haven't you ever
thought of it?

There are some “things” in life that are

necessary, such as food and raiment and

shelter. They are means to an end. They
help to sustain life. They are to life what
fuel is to a fire. The body is an intricate
engine, and it needs protection to enable
it to do its work. But when we put
“things” before thoughts, and make more
of the machine than of the man behind it,
we pave the way to disaster. It was be-

and material things than in manhood and

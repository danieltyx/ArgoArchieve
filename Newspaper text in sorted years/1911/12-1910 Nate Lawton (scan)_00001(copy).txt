“Lo, now is come our joyful’st feast!
Let every man be jolly.

Eache roome with yvie leaves is drest,
And every post with holly.

Now all our neighbor’s chimneys smoke,
And Christmas blocks are burning;
Their ovens they with bak’t meats choke
And all their spits are turning.
Without the door let sorrow lie,

And if, for cold, it hap to die,

Wee'le bury’t in a Christmas pye,

And evermore be merry.”

“THE MAN FROM THE CROWD”
(Sam Walter Foss)

Men seem as alike as the leaves on the trees
As alike as the bees in a swarming of bees;
And we look at the millions that make up the
State

All equally little and all equally great,
And the pride of our courage is cowed.

Then fate calls for a man who is larger

than men
And the man comes up from the crowd.

The chasers of trifles run hither and yon
And the small days of small things still go on
And the world seems no better at sunset than
dawn
And the race still increases its plentiful spawn
And the voice of its wailing is loud.
Then the Great Deed calls out for the
Great Man to come
And the crowd unbelieving sits sullen
and dumb;
But the Great Deed is done for the Great
Man is come,
Aye, the man comes up from the crowd.

There’s a dead hum of voices, all same, the
same thing
And our forefather’s songs are the songs that
we sing.
And the deeds by our fathers and grandfath-
ers done
Are done by the son of the son of the son.
And our heads in contrition are bowed.
Lo, a call for a man who shall make all
things new
Goes down through the thronge—See! he rises
in view.
Make room for the man who shall make
all things new,
For the man who comes up from the
crowd.

And where is the man who comes up
from the throng,
Who does the new deed and who sings the
new song;
And who makes the old world as a world that
is new.

ARGO

And who is the man? Is it you? Is it you?!!
And our praise is exultant and proud.

We are waiting for you there, for you are

the man;

Come up from the jostle as soon as you
can;

Come up from the crowd there as soon
as you can;

The man who comes up from the crowd,

THE GHOST OF HOLLOW LOG CABIN

We four, Tom, Jack, Bob and I, had come
to a little village in Virginia to spend the
summer. The cabin rented low, for it was
said to be haunted by the spirit of a confeder-
ate prisoner since the time of the Civil War.

We arrived late in the afternoon and had
just finished supper. “What was that they
said about the ghost?” I asked, for I had not
yet heard.

“Getting scared,” sneered Bob.

“No, but I should like to hear.”

“Well,” he said, “they told me that years
ago when this cabin was used for a prison,
one of the prisoners died in his cell, which is
now the coal bin, and they say his spirit still
haunts the cabin. The ghost is invisible and
noiseless, except for a chain fastened to his
foot, which every night you can hear him
drag across the cellar floor. He comes to
the stairs and slowly climbs up, step by step,
pausing a long time between each. On reach-
ing the top he seems to listen—for he waits
a long time—then goes down, no faster than
he came up. Now he is heard going from
one part of the cellar to another, pausing oc-
casionally. At last the noise will retire to the
coal bin, where it had begun, and there cease.”

“T'll bet it don’t happen while we're here,”
I volunteered.

Tom started to reply—but suddenly all were
forced to stop and listen. Sure enough, we
heard the sound of the chain on the cellar
floor. We all started, listening intently. It
certainly was the metalic clank of a chain on
the stones, and it came from the coal bin.
Now it was approaching the stairs. Once it
stopped, seemingly at the ice box. After a
short pause it came to the stairs and slowly
mounted just as Bob had said it would. There
was a long wait at the top before it slowly
descended and went.into the pantry. After
stopping there for a time, it withdrew to the
coal bin.

“No one moved. Finally I burst out, “Come
on up stairs, we can’t sit here forever.”

We didn’t do much sleeping that night, but
by the next morning we were again ourselves
and wondered why, the night before, we were
such cowards as not to go down and investi-
gate then and there.

By the next night we had determined on a
plan of action and when the noise stopped at
the head of the stairs, we picked up the
lamp and crept out to the cellar door. Sud-

 
40

denly flinging it open we peered down. Noth-
ing could be seen, the light of the lamp so
blinded us, and we heard only a rapid clank-
ing of chain as the “ghost” beat a hasty re-
treat down the stairs and across the floor to
the coal bin.

Receiving fresh courage putting the demoa
to flight, we followed him down, Jack going
ahead with the lamp. Nothing seemed the
matter with the coal bin, where we had the
“ghost” cornered. There was nothing there
but a few lumps of coal and in one corner a
drain pipe. Hunt as we might nothing could
be found, not even the chain of the “ghost,”
and we had to return upstairs, and, for a
time, give up the mystery.

Determining to find out by the next night
what it was, Tom and I went down to the
village store and were able to secure’ four
good burglar lamps and four revolvers.

THE KING IN THE CATACOMBS.
(Continued from the November Issue.)

For
slowly

a moment I was stunned, then
sat up and groped around. Ah,
that was what I slipped on, probably;
what was it? I felt it and it was
my candle just too late! I tried to get up but
my head reeled and I fell again. I lay still
and went quickly to sleep. When I woke up
I was for a moment puzzled to know where
I was, but soon remembered all of my ad-
ventures. I got up and started feeling my
way along, but I immediately crouched down
behind a pillar for I saw a light coming
near. Soon I was able to recognize the two
figures behind it as those of the priest and the
same man who had come down before. ‘fhe
priest carried a plate in his hand, and I easily
guessed that they were going to give the king
some food. As they passed me my foot
knocked against the pillar and I was sure
that they must hear me, but evidently they
did not, for they paid no- attention. 1 crept
around to the other side of the pillar and

tood.

THE ARGO

Supper was over early that night and hay-
ing loaded the pistols and lighted the lainps,
I led the way downstairs. The plan was to
wait, with lamps closed down, at the foot of
the cellar stairs, until we heard the “demen”
on the second step, press hands as a signal,
and throw the light on the “ghost.”

Everything went all right, though it was
rather “spooky” when the chain started to
rattle. The sound came nearer—pausing here
and there. At last it seemed directly in front
of us and unable to restrain ourselves longer
we all pressed hands. The lights flared up,
but nothing could we see. However, on
glancing down, we beheld a gaunt old rat,
whose hind leg was caught in a piece of
rusty chain stretching on the cellar floor,

Having killed the “Ghost of Hollow Log
Cabin,” we retired and had a peaceful night's
rest. —I2,
could see the king lying on the bench. ‘They
removed his gag and started to give him
I did not wait however, for i saw a
chance to escape.

I stooped down and took off my shoes, so
as to make no noise, and ran quickly in the
direction whence the men had come. It was
not so hard to find the steps with che lig'it of
the lantern the men had, flickering through
the arches to help me and soon I was clinib-
ing, as quickly as possible, up them. I wus
none too soon, however, for just as I enterea
the ante-chapel, where I had come in, I heard
the door to the catacombs close behind the
two men. Evidently no one had been in the
chapel since I, as the ladder was just where
I left it. I climbed up and down again on the
outside and after pulling the ladder down ran
quickly back to the hotel. I myself was in
sympathy with the king and determined to
rescue him if possible.

After thinking about it a while I hit on a
plan which I thought would work. I went
first to the homes of three of the staunchest
royalists and they agreed to act with me.
 

‘THE

That night all four of us together went to the
cathedral and [ knocked four times on the
door as | had heard the man do who had en-
tered before. After a short time the door
opened on a crack and we heard the voice of
the priest saying, “What do you wish here?”
Without replying together we pushed the door
open and easily overpowered the priest. We
bound and gagged him and then took a bunch
of keys out of his pocket. We fitted these
one by one to the lock of the hidden door un-
til we found the proper key. We had pro-
vided ourselves with a lantern and after lignt-
ing this, descended into the catacombs. After
a little search we found the king; we gave
him some whiskey to strengthen him and
when he was able to talk he told us that he
had been getting just enough food to keep
him alive. With our help he was able to
walk to the steps and up them. We tied large
knots in the ropes which held the priest's
feet, to keep him busy until we could get out
of the way, and then unbound his hands. 1
parted from the king and the royalists and
heard nothing more from them except a let-
ter from each thanking me for my services.
Enclosed in the king’s letter was a ring which

he sent as a token of his gratitude. He ex-

plained that as all his money had been taken
with his palace he could not pay me. The
next week the Austrians sent over a portion of
their army and after a short struggle they
seized Terens. Of course my paper got the
story of the king’s escape first and owing to
a friend who was reporting in Austria and
who found out about the army and kept me
posted as to. its movements, I was on the
look out for it when it came, so the Telegram
got this story first too.

Ina short time I went back to America and
was greeted cordially by the two “chiefs” of
my paper, and I got the raise in salary. I
wasn’t quite a millionaire, but I had enough
to have a small apartment and to support
another person, who had, as I have said, been
waiting for some time for that raise in salary.

Kor the past years drill has been conducted
in Prep. and has been one of its strong points,
this makes it convenient tor teliows who waat
a little drill but do not wish to attend a military
academy. Year before last drill was dropped
on account of our not being able to get an
instructor. Last year it was oftered agam,
but only a few fellows took it. This year it
is prescribed and every one is forced to take
it except in cases where physical conditions
will not allow it. Instead of steady drill, the
most important factors of the “Boy Scout”
laws will be introduced, such as preparing
camp, “wig-wagging” and first aid to the in-
jured duties. Drill started Nov. 21st under
the direction of Lieutenant Ahrends, a grad-
uate of West Point. The uniforms wili be
the regular army fatigue suits made of khaki,
while the squad will use repeating rifles (pro-
bably .22 calibre. Lieut. Ahrends is inter-
ested in marksmanship and will have gallery
practise started as soon as possible.

 

A football banquet was given, on Friday
evening, November 18, to the team. The
whole squad, including Coaches Alverson and
Ziegler, was present. Also Messrs. Scudder,
Boardman, and Lewis, representing the fac-
ulty.: Speeches were made by Messrs. Scud-
der, Lewis, Alverson, Ziegler, White, (capt.)
and Schumacher (mgr.), while Mr. Board-
man acted as toastmaster. Following the ban-
quet the election of next year’s captain was
held and “Dave” Succop was unanimously —
elected. Although this is Succop’s first year
at Prep., he has made a good showing at
tackle and earned the honor. The prospects
are bright for another good team next year as
five of this year’s men will be back, Konow,
Succop, Ley, Grombacher and White.

 
 

 

 

THE

The vesper service, at the Trap, Nov. 2oth,
was made very interesting by Mr. Raven's

talk on the subject, “As a Man Thinketh.” €
We are always glad to have some of the °

college professors with us for this informal
meeting for they have many thoughts helpful
to us. The main point in his discourse was

about looking on the bright and not the blue &

side of life. Those who have dark thoughts
see dark things, but those who have bright
thoughts see bright things before them.

We are glad to have an athletic field of our
own. The college has always ;been very good
to us in allowing us to use their field for our
games, etc., but as Rutgers is steadily increas-
ing in size, we feel that they need the field for
themselves. Our new field is directly opposite
the college field on College avenue and 4al-
though it has not yet been leveled off and
“beautified” it is of good size and will make
a fine one when completed. It is on the site
where the new Trap. will soon be located.

THE BASKETBALL OUTLOOK

The outlook for a good basketball team this
year is very bright. Besides several of last
year’s men there is lots of new material.
Thus far the fellows have turned out well’ in

“support of this branch of athletics, in spite of

the fact that practise comes at a very incon-
venient time. It is to be hoped that this good
spirit will continue throughout the season.
This year it is up to the team to make good
and wipe out all of last year’s defeats. The
team will do its best for the school and it is
for the fellows to support the team to the
best of their ability, which means that every
fellow in the school should attend every home
game and that a good crowd will go to the out
of town games.

Rutgers Prep. has completed one of the
most successful football seasons -in many
years. The team was light, but fast and
snappy. The schedule consisted of ten games,
Prep. won six, tied one, lost two and won one
on a forfeit.

Coaches Alverson and Ziegler undoubtedly
put their best into the team and instilled in
them a snappy spirit not seen in many school
teams.

At the beginning of the season the pros-
pects were decidedly dubious, the material
was green. In the first game of the season
they put up a very poor exhibition of football.
In the next two they were beaten. Then they
began to brace up. The team was at its best
in the Wilson game, playing good, fast foot-
ball against a heavier team. In the Newark
Academy game they showed their fighting
spirit, when five different times they held
Newark on the goal line when a touchdown
meant defeat.

The Players.

Capt. White played good, consistent ball all
season at quarterback, and led his team in
good shape. He ran the ball well at times
and made a good field general,

Voorhees at the first of the season was
without a doubt the star of the backfield. He
hit the line hard, picked the holes well, and
gained more ground than any player in the
backfield. In one game he scored all three of
the touchdowns. He tackled in good style,
and played a fine game as defensive halfback.

Konow was not in shape at the first of the
season, but at the last he starred for the whole
team, doing fine work in the backfield. In
the Wilson game he was brilliant, never fail-
ing to make his distance when called upon.
His line plunging was brilliant, it being seem-
ingly impossible to stop him.

Stinson at fullback, played a steady, con-
sistent game, never brilliant, but always re-
liable. He made the best interference of any
man in the backfield, and was the surest
tackler on the team. He had lots of fight in
him and never quit.

Ley held down his end position well, in
spite of the fact that he had a sprained shoul-
der. Always fast under punts and forward
passes and sure on tackles, Ley played a fine,
consistent game. He put lots of “pep” into
the team and never was beaten.

»Grombacher was undoubtedly the best man
for catching forward passes. He played a
fast, clean game all season at end.

Dougherty’s position was always well taken
care of, and he could usually be depended up-
on when a gain was needed. Dougherty
knew the game from A to Z and had a great
habit of kidding his opponents until they got
sore.

Succop, who acted as captain in White's
absence, played one of the snappiest games
for the team. He put a spirit and a vigor ‘n
the line that was good when a pinch came,

pand the line needed to hold.

‘

 

THE ARGO

Van Sickle played a good, steady game in
the line, always on the job, and often he broke
through to block a punt. His weight was
greatly needed in the line, and he was like
a stone wall when our opponents threatened
our goal line.

Hollander played a good, hard game at
guard, always doing his best and always play-
ing his game.

Richardson played his position at center in
good shape, and was one of the props in the
line. In the latter part of the season he got
water on the knee and had to stop playing.

The Arco wishes to acknowledge the fol-
lowing exchanges:

Advocate, Red and White, Signal, Register,
Recorder, Irvonian, Iliad, Targum, On Bonds,
Spectator, X(cellentidea), M. A. S. Monthly,
Mirror, Echo, Red and Blue, Voice, Hilltop,
Bulletin, Oracle, Orange, Kearnican, Ledger,
Waahoo.

The Ledger comes to us as our new ex-
change. Its appearance is neat and attrac-
tive, its matetial good and well spaced’ and
its cuts clever. Taken as a whole the paper
is Our best exchange for this month.

The Recorder is nearly as good as the Led-
ger, but its appearance is not as neat and its
cuts are not as good. ‘

Another fine paper that is new to us is the
Hilltop from Jersey City H. S. It has a fine
appearance and is very well edited. One at-
tractive feature of this paper is the originality
of its cuts. We see in the Hilltop a column
that is not often seen in school papers and one
that is needed, namely, the Faculty column.

The Irvonian is a good paper of the quar-
terly class, but might be improved a lot by a
larger editorial department.

The cover of the Register is well drawn.
The paper this year, we are glad to say, has a
decided improvement over that of last year,
both in appearance and material.

Congress at its recent session passed a bill
admitting the territories of New Mexico and
Arizona as sister states of the Union. Al-
though the president approved the measure,
the new states will not actually come into the
Union until certain formalities are complied
with. This will take some time, and the two
new stars will not properly belong on the flag
until July 4, 1911. For the first time in more
than a generation the stars will appear in a
perfect parallelogram—eight stars across the
top and six stars deep. Heretofore it has
been a problem to dispose them symmetrically,
but the number forty-eight permits of regular
arrangement.—The Home News.

An old farmer on being told that a new

48 . THE
WINTER.
Ole Mistah Winter’s comin’ on,
I feel it in mah bones;
T mind de way de shutters bang
An’ how de cold win’ groans,
De leaves am droppin’ from de trees,
An’ every plant looks sad,
An’ yesterday de robin left
Dat pleasant home he had.

Ole Mistah Winter’s gettin’ close,
Ah feel his cold bref nigh,
An’ dere is now an angry look
Off yonder in de sky.
De pickaninnies go to bed
As soon as dey’ve had tea,
An’ once again de roomatiz
Is catchin’ hold of me.

Ole Mistah Winter’s on de way.
He'll soon be heah, doggone it.
Las’ night Ah tuk mah fiddle down
An’ put a new string on it.
An’ den Ah played dat Old Black Joe,
De way Ah used t’ do.
An’ said: ‘““Mah head is bendin’ low,
Dear Lord, Ah’se comin’ too.”’
Detroit Free Press.

NOT WHAT HE EXPECTED.

As the brisk philanthropist thurst ‘her fare
into the cab-driver’s hand, she saw that he
was wet and apparently cold after the half
hour of pouring rain. “Do you ever take
anything when you get soaked through?” she
asked.

“Yes, ma’am,” said the cabman with hu-
mility, “I generally do.”s

“Wait here in the vestibule,” commanded
the philanthropist.. She inserted her house
key in the lock, opened the door and vanished
to reappear a moment later.

“Here,” she said, putting a small envelope
in the man’s outstretched hand. “These are
two-grain quinine pills; you take two of them
now and two more in half an hour.’”—Se-
lected.

His Idea of Sport.

Pittsburg has a physician who is not only an
ardent sportsman, but a gallant one as well.
Being a crack shot, he would not think of
shooting a rabbit which was sitting still nor
a pheasant or partridge which was on the
ground or perched upon a limb, considering
such easy shots to be tame and unsportsman-
like. Among his acquaintances is a man who
is much given to boasting of his prowess with
a gun, and with the opening of the shooting
season, the doctor invited him out to his coun-
try place for a day’s shooting. They had not
gone far when the dog started a pheasant
from some bushes and the bird, instead of
taking flight at once, scuttled out into the
open and ran along the ground for some dis-
tance. In such cases the true sportsman will
wait till the bird rises in the air, disdaining
anything but a “wing shot.” The guest, how-
ever, promptly dropped to his knee and took
aim at the bird as it scampered along the
ground.

“Wait, wait!” cried the doctor. “Don’t
shoot him yet; don’t shoot while he is run-
ning!”

“No, no,” whispered the other excitedly
“I’m not going to. T’ll wait till he stops.”—
Pittsburg Gazette-Times.

“STUNG.”

The Knocker and the Lapser met on the
street and shook hands in harmonious dis-
gruntlement. “Let’s start an order after our
own ideas,” said the Lapser. “No; I am
afraid you would lapse,” replied the Knocker.
“Come to think of it, I wouldn’t want to he in
any order with you, anvhow,” retorted the
Tanser: “you’re a Knocker.” Thus fate dis-

ilusioned each of his importance-—Roval
Highlander.

 

“Well. well,” said the absent minded pro-
fessor in the bathtub, “now T’ve forgotten
what TI got in here for.”"—Evr.

Spit on yer hands an’ hump yourself an’

Don't get sore.

There’s times when things don’t go just right

When things are needed, money scarce, an’

It might be you’re not paid enough; your work

But thank the Lord for what you've got an’

Don’t get sore.

Your chance will come; jest do yer best, an’

The man who’s got a grievance is the man all

people shun;
For folk have trouble of their own; your

woes just merely bore;
Brace up, keep mum, an’ grin, old sport, an’
Don’t get sore.

She flung herself into his arms,

It was a most unladylike thing to do.

Even if she had been acquainted with the
man it would not have seemed becoming in so
public a place.

Yes, it was simply useless for her to fight
against the impulse.

It was not her fault that the seats in the
car ran lengthwise, neither could she be blam-

day.

Dean Washington, in the heat of a revival,
shouted from the Nola Chucky chapel:

“T see befo’ me ten chicken thieves, includin’
that thar Calhoun Clay.”

Calhoun Clay at once rose and left the
church. He was very angry. He brought
several powerful influences to bear and the
deacon promised to apologize.

So at the following revival the old man
said:

“T desire to retract mah last night’s remark,
namely—I see befo’ me ten chicken thieves in-
cludin’ Calhoun Clay. What I should have
said, dear brethren and sistern, was—'T see
befo’ me nine chicken thieves, not includin’
Calhoun Clay.”—Detroit Free Press.

 

Smith: “Do you find it hard to wake in

Jones: “Not a bit. After the cook calls

pulls me out of bed at 7.15, I seldom have to

A Wall Street broker has a boy who stut-

hours. When he returned, the broker asked
him how much he had charged for his ser-

“F-ff-ff-fi-fi-fifteen c-c-c-c-cents!” was the
gasping reply.

On board an ocean liner were a lady and a
gentleman, accompanied by their young hope-
ful, aged six, and as is usually the case the
parents were very sick, while little Willie was
the wellest thing on board. One day the par-
ents were lying in their steamer chairs hoping
that they would die, and little Willie was play-
ing about the deck.

Willie did something of which his mother
did not approve, so she said to her husband:
“John, please speak to Willie.” The husband,
with the little strength left in his wasted form,
looked at his son and heir and feebly mut-
tered: “How’dy do, Willie."—The Lyceumite.

Mike: “Is it true that thim glass eyes be

Pat: “Sure, you fool; an’ how could any-

An English soldier supposed to have been
killed in India was entered on the books o1
his company:

“Died on the 24th of June,” etc.

A few days afterward it turned out that he
was still alive, and the honest sergeant made
the following entry:

“Died by mistake.”

At length there came a letter from the Min-
ister of War announcing the death of the man
at the hospital, when the sergeant recorded the
fact as follows:

“Re-died by order of the Ministry.”--

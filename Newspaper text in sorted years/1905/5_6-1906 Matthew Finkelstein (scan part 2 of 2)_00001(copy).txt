The calendar’s always marked with care,
For Patrick’s Day we shamrocks wear,
For Valentine’s day the dining-room glows

With hearts upon hearts all strung up in rows.

Hallowe’en had a feast that was quite unique,
In each little cake an emblem you'd seek,—
To Hansen the modest a diamond did fall
Which proved he’d be married first of us all.

To Mark went the whistle—he makes such a
noise—

Scott got the bottle to doctor the boys,

Cox got the button to sew on his clo’es,

Green and Black got the bells, because they're
the beaux,

We bobbed for red apples, the candy we
stirred,

The racket we made, you just ought to have
heard,

We had peanut races, bit rings out of flour,

We sang our school songs till a very late hour.

The hot cross buns, the Paas eggs gay,

Showed how the Spring term was passing
away.

We danced with the Tau Phies, we danced
with the Betes,

And at College Farm with the Delta Thetes.

At the Thanksgiving banquet we all ate our
fill;

At the Christmas one we'd a nervous chill,

Holly and greens made the dining room gay,

But we each had a toast of our own to say.

From Rutgers Faculty came welcome guests,

Dr. Payson. as toastmaster, made many jests.

We sang ail our songs and everything toasted,

Anil who wes the fellow that didn’t get
roasted ?

The Prof. with the Kodak failed to come
’round,—.

It's the only time in the year, I’ll be bound,—

He’s taken us indoors, ‘he’s taken us out,

In coats, in pajamas, the thin and the stout.

Mike showed up his art with a lantern so
bright

We met in the school-room one warm summer
night,——

Whenever a picture was stuck up in sight,

If Mike said "twas Case, we knew he was
right.

From Doctor's reading, we’ve gained Shakes-
peare lore—

Hamlet, Othello, and several more,—

His Bible class also gave as much knowledge,

You'd think we came straight from Theologi-
cal College.

Before the end we'll meet once more
To honor the seniors—quite a score :—
With blossoms gay and lanterns bright
The Trap will be a festive sight.

Commencement Day is drawing night
When to the Trap we'll say good-bye.

To Scarlet and White we'll loyal be

As long as the Raritan runs to the sea.

 

THE MEET OF RUTGERS.

Cn May nineteenth the annual meet of Rut-
gers College was held at Neilson Field. In
this meet Nicholas won third place in 220
yard dash. Cox won the first place in high
jump by a splendid exhibition, beating Rut-
gers’ record by 2 3-4 inches, clearing 5 feet,
8 inches. Cox is to be congratulaiedi on his
magnificent showing.

PREP. SCHOOL FRATERNITIES.

“A fraternity,” says Mr. Webster, “is a
body of men associated for their common in-
terest, business, or pleasure, a brotherhood.”
According to collegiate usage, the term “fra-
ternity” is applied only to organizations hav-
ing chapters in more than one institution. .AJ-
though the societies in Rutgers Prep. School
are local in character, yet, since they meet the
cictionary definition, they may justly be term-
ed fraternities.

Of the fraternities, Tau Phi is the oldest,

the latter part of the

school.

As far as is generally known, good charact-
er and good fellowship are the main qualifica-
tions for membership. Scholastic, literary and
athletic ability also are considered.

The fraternities] aim at the promotion of
brotherly feeling in their ranks, and the im-
provement of the moral, mental and physical
natures of their: members. ‘

_ They are of great benefit to, the individual
members, and to the school as a whole. The
friendly rivalry for scholastic honors be-
tween the fraternities does much in the way
of furnishing an incentive for hard work. The
student learns to strive in the class-room and
cn the field with-nobler aims than his own

personal glorification. ~He forms close and

lasting friendships, and comes to know the
vale of unselfishness and brotherly love.
And finally, these’ fraternities lend to the
school life an interst.and a charm which
binds the hearts of the students yet closer to

Rutgers Prep.

THE SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE.
I shall never forget the terrible earthquake
at San Francisco in April, 1905; how I was
awakened from my sleep by the shocks, and
all that. I saw and heard while I was trying
to get away. from the city. As it happened I
was travelling for a Denver firm. I had a
young colored man, Sam, along with me, for
we had grown up together and had always
been the best of friends, and I usually took
him with me on business trips. He helped me
in many little ways.and I always enjoyed his
comnany—especially when anything mysteri-
ous happened, for he was very superstitious.

We were staying at a large hotel in San
Francisco, and had a front room on the third’
floor. Sam slept on a cot in the corner, while
I had the bed. I had had a busy day and was
much pleased at the thought of a good night’s
sleep. As I slept [ had a strange dream. |

the boat began to pitch violently and giving a
sudden jerk threw me into the water. I could
not swim bet I somehow managed to float. I

end then somebody grabbed me! I gave a yell
and at once awoke. The room was swaying in
a jerky fashion and I was sitting in the mid-
dle of the floor with Sam holding on to me.
He was frightened almost out of his senses
and his eyes were glowing like a cat’s at

_night. “Massa George,” he gasped, “de Jedge-

garians who lived across the street, whom
he disliked.)

~ Clancing out of the window, I saw that the
house across the way was in flames and many
other fires were breaking out. The streets
were filled with fleeing people and there was
the greatest cenfusion. Just then a man in his
nightshirt pavsed a moment in the doorway
of our room and Sam gasping, “It’s de angel”
dove under the bed and tried to drag me after
him. The man said: “You must all come,
quickly! Mr. Ha'nes?” “Here I am,” I ans-
Wered. “Samuel!” “Absent,” called a weak
little voice from under the bed. The man,
smiling, ran on and I finally persuaded Sam

THE DANDELION.

There was once a seed that was very proud.
He was even more proud than the beautiful
flower. One day the proud seed asked an-
other seed, that was lying beside it, what it
was going to be. “I don’t know yet,” said the
little seed. “What are you going to be?” “I
am going to be,” said the proud seed, “the
king of flowers and wear a gold crown and
reign high.”

The other seeds laughed at this and said,
“You are only going to be like the rest of
us. You will nct te a king.” The proud seed
grew more provd. At last the time came
when it was to grow. One day it said, “I
have had a drink cf water at last! I’m grow-
ing! Cood-bye.” Up it went. It pushed itself
through tke ground and saw so many things.

 

 

 

It heard the chirpping of the birds and the
singing of the brook as it went along. The
proudness left it and it was only a golden

dandelion.

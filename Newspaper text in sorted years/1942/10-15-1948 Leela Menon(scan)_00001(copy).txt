Issue _No.One One

Rutgers Prep failed to make an
impressive showing in the first
game of the season when they lost
to Pennington Prep 19-0 on October
2. The visitors scored in all but
the third period. The touchdowns
were made by Feairheller, Mclfullin,
and Hendricks. The longest run of
the game was turned in by Hendricks
when he raced 66 yards for the
first Pennington tally.

In the second game of the season
the tables were exactly reversed,
when Rutgers Prep completely out-
classed Montclair Academy in a
driving rainstorm, The cheering at
the second game was slightly better
but far from good. All three
touchdowns were scored by John
Garboski, and Bill Driscoll made
good two of the three conversions.
The final score 20-0.

We now have a percentage of 1 & 1
With our forthcoming victory over
Hun this Friday we will increase it
to2&1.

The football team is out working
hard, the least the non-football
players can do is get out and
support the toam. So come this
Friday to Johnson Park = let's see
100 per cent attendance. We beat
Hun last year 20-0, there's no
reason why we won't do it again,

THE TRAPS

“The Traps", as the boarding
‘school is commonly known by al-
most everyone in Prep, is a very
jntriguing place, both-for the
varied oddities you may find there
and for its superb location over-
looking the Raritan md flats and
Johnson Park (adopted training
field for Johnny Miske, well known
Delta House plane enthusiast).

At the Traps there are four dis-
tinct and different houses, which
boast of many well known (or should
T say “notorious") personalities.
In the Delta House, largest of
them all, we have the great radio
and phonograph genius, D.C.(not A.
C.) Wurtzel, and his radio supply
shop completely equipped with Chet
Turdo, and a fire escape, in case
of an explosion. Before we leave
the Dcolta House we should by all
means make a trip to the basement
and view the "coke" machino with
its beautiful “sold out" sign, The
rulers of this house are idr. A, 4.
Holley and ir. J. B. Grove, ping
pong and piano novices, respective-
lye

Tho next stop on our wanderings
sakes us to the Gamma Houso, the
all athletic house...Here we havo
Perth Amboy's gift to Prepe.. Phil
Karkus, fencer, golfer, and grid-
iron triple threat. Also Walt

Quinn, the boy with all the low

golf score cardSeees We also have
ir, Downie, Mr. Oneal, Mrs.Andrews,
and one-half of the Bordini-Shinn
ping pong champs.

The Beta House is quiet this year
with the smallest group of any of
the housese We might pass the
comment that Mr. Martin has gotten
larger coffee cups.

We come at last to the Alpha
House, last year's Campus Droad.
Even ifr, Heinlein couldn't take ite
Only threo of last years group are
left - Jim Efinger, mourning his
love life lost to Jack Powers, Ray
Henderson, and last years Aerial
Tennis Champ, Ed Lunn.

All in all, the Traps boast a
swell group, and it will be worth
while for the day students to ven-
ture up to George and Huntington
Streots..etours leave on the hour.

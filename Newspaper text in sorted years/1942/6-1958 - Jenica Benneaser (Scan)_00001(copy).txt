Reports that the fund-raising

projects for the new school site are
moving quickly were confirmed to-
day by Mr. Heinlein. He states that
funds are being collected with lit-
tle or no difficulty; that most
people approached for aid have
given generously. In view of these
forementioned conditions, he pre-
dicted that the goal is well within
reach and close to completion.
Enough money has been promised to
fulfill our momentary obligations,
and insure a surplus to improve the
school in accordance with our most
optimistic plans.

Off To The Woods

Meanwhile, other plans for the
schoo] site are coming along well.
This summer, the estate will be
the base from which a group of
thirty adventurous boys will explore
the surrounding fields and water-
ways in search of nature’s elusive
wonders. Their journeys will include
sojourns into the woods on nature
trails, which are being constructed
at the site in conjunction with
school science courses, and canoe
trips on the Raritan and other
local waters.

In addition, temporary athletic
fields, which will be made perma-
nent for our teams, will be con-
structed this summer.

HAWAIIAN HOP A HIT

Raw fish and a salty, soggy sea
was all that was missing from the
grand finale to this year’s school-
social-schedule. The theme of the
fete “Hawaiian Sunset”, was an
original idea of our inimitable Bruce
Miller.

The atmosphere of the south-sea
celebration was pervaded by a dis-
tinctly exotic charm. This was a
result of many factors: effective
tropical decorations, Hawiian music,
refreshments, dancers and many
students sporting Hawaliianish ap-
parel.

The International Club and Stu-
dent Council members participating
found the preparation required a
great deal of work because they

which is reported as being very
good. Refreshments will be served

Unanimous Praise Follows
R.P.’s Spring Performance

May 9th 1958 the
Rutgers Prep Players, under the
capable direction of Mr. Thomas
Dumarae, produced “The Enemy” a
play by Channing Pollack. The play
starred Danny Struk, Ricky Kluft,
and Gaby Gibbs.

The play was an_ exceptionally
fine job and more lustre was added
to it because of the difficulty caused
at rehearsals by sickness and the
Easter vacation.

The play expresses the horror and
tragedy of war. However, to express

Prom Wins Over Trip

During the last three years the
prom has been outvoted in favor
of a class trip to New York. This
year, however, the Senior and Junior
Classes decided it would be nice
to continue the old tradition of
having a prom.

Linda Levy is the prom chairman
and her committee consists of Mary
Bunting, decoration chairman, Jay
Goldsmith, Bob Eber, refreshment
chairman, Danny Struk and Bruce
Gunkle. Martin Levowitz, Edward
Pellichero, Jon Margolis and Bob
Bronfman are the Senior represent-
atives.

In a fight to the finish Danny
Struk and Linda Levy became the
new president and vice president
respectively, Bruce Miller obtained
the secretary's position and Paul
Gottlieb and Suzy Margolis won the
remaining offices.

“Cc” Party and “R.P.” Party Run—

This year for the first time in
half a decade the students of Rut-
gers Preparatory School saw de-
mocracy in action. Yes, this year
two parties were running, the R.P.
party and the Conservative Party.
A number of independents ran, but
only one copped an honor. The
school looked like that small prin-
cipality which waves banners and
shoots off cannons every time a
new baby is born; only in this case
a Student Council was. born.

 

 

Stirring Speeches

The campaign was marked by
vigorous speeches, posters and even
mysterious footprints on the ceiling
of the study hall.

Suzy Margolis, the new delegate
gave an oration which had the
assembly really clapping. The two
candidates for president, Jay Gold-
smith and Danny Struk also be-
came junior Demosthenes.

The election was fun and the best
men won, only in this case, for
the first time in Prep’s history two
girls obtained seats in the Student
Council.

This year’s candidates were very
original in their slogans. The con-
servative party passed out “C” but-
tons and had such slogans as “Vote
“Cc” all the way” and “Continue
Good Government.” The “R.P.”
party made itself known by “R.P.
and see” and “Govern Prep good
as a student council should.”
Bernard Karshmer advertised the
“RP.” party by breaking the study
hall clock in putting a sign up.
Suzy Margolis had very clever
posters everywhere one looked.

The faculty hopes next year’s
student council will do an even
better job than that done by the
sparkling and ever witty Martin

From The Editor’s Desk

In this editor's humble opinion a prep school newspaper should do
a great deal more than merely report the activities of a school — its
student body, its faculty, its athletic teams, its scholastic achievements.
I grant that keeping abreast of current school events allows students to
Participate and to broaden their school interests and understandings. It
is my thinking, however, that a school paper — to complete its func-
tion — must exemplify the pride which the student body has in its school,
must portray the enthusiasm embodied in the students and teachers, and
dramatize the achievements which are the result of learning to develop
thinking and physical processes during formative prep school years.

A school paper affords an opportunity to enterprising students to
express themselves, for in addition to reporting daily occurences and
listing forthcoming events it is an outlet for creative thinking and writ-
ing. This purpose is too often overlooked in the hustle and bustle of
“getting the latest edition on the press.”

Also, although of lesser importance, a schoo] paper is the compila-
tion of the history of the school. As such, it must have as complete
coverage as possible while maintaining its interest for present readers

thinking only in current terms.

To the students, a school news-
paper is often a target for witty
abuses and casual stoning. They
enjoy this, and it is their privilege.
The staff is not guiltless of such
action, but indulges equally in jest-
ing appraisals of their labor. Al-
though some may feel otherwise,
such action is healthy. It is an
indication of vitality in the paper,
for at least it is being read and is
evidently making an impression. The
staff views the paper as a mark
of achievement; to the reader it is
a prototype of his school.

Consequently, the newspaper staff
has an incalculable responsibility to

|

Linda Levy

himself, his fellow student and to
anyone within the framework or
outside of the school who may read
his work. Thus, the newspaper staff
member holds one of the most re-
sponsible and respectable positions
in the school. The paper he produces
is not only a measure of the school’s
achievement in training him, but
the ideas and attitudes he expresses
directly affect the thinking and
morale of the reader. The news-
paper should therefore be percep-
tive, critical, provocative and free
of prejudice. Such is the policy the
Argo attempts to maintain.

CONTENTMENT —

The ripe rains fall on the doleful
dwelling

Soft and silent, soothingly slow.

Deep within the darkling dwelling

Lies the lazy listless longing,

And warm within it woefully
wonders.

While without the wailing wind
weeps,

And dreams of the darkling dwelling

Safe from swiftly sliding seasons.

All the months have passed away
And left us black and torn.

All the months have passed away,
And left us here reborn.

FLASH
EXAMS — JUNE 4-10

 

 

Dear Editor:

When June draws near I hear so
many gripes about school that I
feel that it’s appropriate to tell
about some of the things that make
Rutgers Prep a worthwhile and en-
joyable school.

One memorable day last Septem-
ber I watched my former school,
Metuchen High, go up in smoke,
flames and soot and as the sun
rose over the smoldering ruins the
next morning, I awoke with the
realization that my future education
was dim. However, any dimness was
quickly dispensed with my enroll-
ment into Prep.

Being a newcomer makes it easy
for me to show the joys of a Prep
education. Nervously and shyly I
had entered my first class and
discovered Joy Number I. That is
friendliness, a spirit connected with
smaller and closer knit schools like
Rutgers Prep.

Later I discovered Joy Number II.
That is relaxation. Found in many
classrooms, it enables the student
to enjoy the class in a relaxed, yet
attentive state of being.

Still later I discovered the most
helpful Joy, Joy Number III. Every
student’s questions and contributions
are considered worthwhile, and it’s
the privilege of the student to ex-
press his ideas.

These ideas and others show that
a Rutgers Prep education is a
direct path to college.

Yours truly,
Miles Merwin

INTERVIEW

One day, many years ago, a man
walked up to Rutgers Preparatory
School. In his hand was a suitcase
and in his mind was the idea that
this venture was not a good one.
This man, Mr. A.Z. Holley, was
sure, in fact, that he would spend
no more than one year at this
school. His idea was even more
magnified when, walking by the
house of the headmaster, on his way
o the dormitories which were
where the Rutgers Library is now,
(Prep was a boarding school then)
the headmaster’s happy-go-lucky dog
jumped on him and bit Mr. Holley
on the ankle. However, even this
wouldn’t drive A.Z. Holley away.

Somewhat after the one year
which he was planning to spend
at Prep, Mr. Holley can still remem-
ber his early, happy years. One boy
who came from South America
was a strong anti-bath taker. Al-
though the boy didn’t mind it, his
dorm-mates did not enjoy his “fra-

 

grance.” Finally, one night, after
jasking the boy to bathe, all verbal
requests were stopped and the boy
was taken to the canal and dumped
in. The boy took regular baths
after that.

“It's a far cry from anything I'd

“I agree with you 100%!" said
her twin.

‘Look at that one over there,”
squealed the first. “It looks just

“And how!” came the reply.

As I walked down George Street
and saw all the latest fashions, I
agreed whole-heartedly with the
conversation I had just overheard.

The sack does look like a mater-

happened to the figure the
smart women used to cherish and
the alert male used to admire?

pang of sympathy for the condition
of the gal within the chemise.

The tentlike trapeze would be
wonderful for smuggling things, but
nothing else. If you wished to steal

Third in Math Exam|

Florence Schmitt, Rutgers Prep’s
representative at the Seventh State
Mathematic’s Day at Rutgers, par-
ticipated in the competitive exami-
nation. Florence placed third highest
among the girls competing.

The contest was held April 26,
1958, State Mathematic’s Day at
Rutgers. The mathematical exam

was to test the competitor's aptitude
more than his knowledge of math.
The math involved in the exam was
no more advanced than Plane Ge-
ometry and Algebra I. Along with
Florence, there were two hundred
and seventy other competitors. The
contest was sponsered by Rutgers
University and the state Mathemat-
ical Teacher's Association.

Maroon - White
Field Day

The 150-odd Prepsters had a lit-
eral field day at their annual field
day, Monday, May 26 in Johnson
Park. Sponsored by the Varsity “R”
Club such firsts as a backward-
forward three legged race and a
giant push-polo game were initiated.
Also highlighted was a senior-faculty
softball game.

The day started at 9:30 and the
first events between the maroon and
white teams of each class began
at 10:00.

During this time we saw such
things as twelve errors in the first
inning of the senior softball game
and an 8 second 100 yard dash.
(We didn’t measure too well.) At
eleven each class switched activities.

A new point system was intro-
duced and points were awarded for
the first three places in each track
event. Five points were given for
each run acquired by a winning
softball team over its opponent.

After all events were completed, the |)

totals were compiled and the win-
ning team announced.

Team captains were Steven
Holsten, Irving Quackenboss, Robert
Carlon, James Dunn, Norman Bate,
Jack McCormick, William Mrazek,
Norman Schubert, William Bunting
and Edward Freedman.

The entire day was planned by
a committee made up of “R” club
members. Bernard Karshmer was
general chairman and Jon Margolis
took care of the bountiful repast.

SCIENTISTS PLAN PROJECT

This year, something of interest
will be added to Prep. The Science
Club will make good use of wasted
space. The Club is building a small
planetarium in an unused room
in the attic above the library. They
hope to complete it soon and show
their work students of astronomy.
This is probably the Science Club’s
most important project of the year.
In former years, the Club used the
library, only as a temporary place,
but this year they hope to model
that attic room into a minature

reproduction of the bigger plane-
tariums.
In England, there were usually

two godmothers to sponsor a child.
They were called “Godsibbs,” a rela-
tive through God, “sibb” being
Anglo-Saxon for “kin.” The two
Godsibbs often met in the home of

their mutual godchild and had chats

together. The term “Godsibbing”
came to be applied to these trivial
talks. Later corrupted to “gossiping,”
the word gradually lost its original
meaning, and now to gossip is to
carry tales or spread scandal.

Colleges Take
Many Seniors

Practically nine-tenths of this
year’s graduating class has received
acceptances into various colleges.
Listed here are a few of the colleges
which they are planning to attend
in September. Bernard Karshmer has
been accepted at the University of
North Carolina, Norman Schubert,
Furman, South Carolina, John
Margolis, Oberlin, Ohio. Accepted
at Douglass College were Florence
Schmitt, Jackie Kaufelt, Kathy
McCabe, and Barbara Lipman. Jim
Burke is one senior who is still
undecided, having been accepted
at Brown, Cornell, and Rutgers
University. Bob Bronfman
was accepted at Rutgers, Louise
DiLalo at Cornell, Gettysberg,
Bucknell and Goucher, Richard
Conrad at Brandeis and Dartmouth,
and Levowitz at Williams and Johns
Hopkins.

Acceptances are coming in every
day. Some seniors are still patiently
waiting to be accepted at the col-
lege of their choice, but we're sure
that our senior class will not have
much trouble. We are certain, how-
ever, that wherever they're accepted
they will put forth their all in
whatever they attempt.

BETWEEN THE LINES

Thomas A. Edison once was fired

 

as a telegraph operator as he
himself explained it, “I got so in-
terested in the danged machine I
forgot to send or deliver the mes-
sages.”

It may seem quite easy to fold
a piece of paper fifty times, but
try it some day you may find
that when you have folded a sheet
of paper three times, it is eight
times its original thickness if you
fold it twenty times, it will be about
twenty yards thick and if you
should be able to fold it twenty-
four times, you will have a thick-
ness of about 450 yards and the
truth is by the time you folded a
sheet of paper thirty times the
thickness would be the diameter of
the earth — by the forty-fourth
time, its thickness would reach the
moon.

Whether in retrospect we like the
guy or not, Julius Caesar was quite
a fellow it was he who first
introduced one-way traffic, set up
parking lots for chariots, and for-
bade wagons to load or unload
during rush hour peaks.

LOWER SCHOOL NEWS
Now that June 5th is nearing, the
“Elementarians” are working harder
than ever. On May 12th, the seventh
graders presented two programs for
their parents in the Rutgers Prep
Gym. Mrs. Taylor’s seventh grade
class gave a minstrel-show, and Mrs.
Dixon’s class gave an_ excellent
performance of a play written by
Peter Wilson — “Waltzing Matilda”
— which concerns a supposed mur-
der.
On Wednesday, May 14, Mrs.
Wolfson’s fourth graders, Mrs. Ke-
hoe’s fifth graders, and Mrs. Ellis’
sixth graders presented a series of
Plays in the Prep School Gym.
Even though Spring fever has
struck 185 College Avenue, the Ele-
mentary School students are busy
reviewing for their final exams.
Everyone is striving for higher
grades, so that they may receive
gold, silver, or bronze scholarship
pins. These awards are presented to
the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh
sraders who have attained grades
of eighty or better, on their “Com-
mencement Day” — June 5th.
Already, the seventh graders are
anxiously awaiting September, when
they not only resume class-mate
friendships, but also join the ranks

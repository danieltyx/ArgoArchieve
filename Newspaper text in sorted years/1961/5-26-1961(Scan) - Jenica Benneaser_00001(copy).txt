Expresses Regret

He said that he regretted his
leaving the school and that he

He added that he had been

Editorial Board States
Reason For Newspaper

As the school year ends, the Argo hopes that it has
served the school as it should throughout the past year.
The primary responsibility of the paper has been and
will continue to be a clear coverage of all school news.

It has attempted to make available to the student
body not only the mere fact or event, since this is
usually known in a school of our size, but also accurate
details which increase an understanding of school affairs.
Through its Student Council report, it has attempted to
keep the student body informed of the Council's actions.

STUDENT BODY...

Through letters to the editor, it offers students an
opportunity to voice their opinions on matters of con-
cern to the school. The Argo recognizes the importance
of this outlet and hopes that students will continue to
take advantage of it.

. . . VOICES OPINIONS . . .

It offers those students who are interested in jour-
nalism an opportunity to learn basic rules of journalism
and ¢o apply these rules in publishing a newspaper.
The editors have an opportunity to visit the annual
Columbia Scholastic Press Association Conference and
to discuss various problems with professional journalists,
journalism teachers, and editors of other school papers.

. . . THROUGH LETTERS

Through its editorials the paper attempts to express
the opinion not merely of the editor-in-chief but of the
entire editorial board. At times these editorials will be
positive or negative. At other times, however, when the
question at hand cannot be definitely answered, both
arguments will be clearly presented to allow the reader |
to make his own judgement with a better understanding
of the alternatives. It is deeply hoped that through its
editorials the paper will encourage the student body to
take a more active interest in school problems. _

Finally, it offers its staff members the fun of putting
out a newspaper, and it is sincerely hoped that next
year more students will take advantage of this opportu-
nity.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Student Council Works
For Exchange Student

The editors of the Argo believe that congratulations
should be extended to President Paul Gottlieb and the
other members of the Student Council who have been
trying to acquire, for the better part of this school year,
an exchange student for our school. After many weeks
of waiting, the Council has finally received the news
_ 7 exchange student has been procured for the
school,

COUNCIL’S ATTEMPTS...

The student comes from Germany and can ake
German, French, Italian, and English. She will Werat
the home of Rev. and/Mrs. Bradford Abernethy. Next
year she will be a member of the senior Class.

The idea of bringing an exchange student to the
school was conceived of by President Gottlieb and car-
nee out by the diligence and hard work of the Student

‘ouncil.

by the cast.

“Whatever you put into it you

M, Ossad: I think it was the

Mr. Dumarae: Magnficent! The
best play-I’ve seen at Prep.

F. Gunckel: Very effective, with
the material at hand; laugh

Mr. Holley; In my 25 years at
Prep probably this was the
finest play ever produced,

Mrs. Wilson: I thought it was
excellent, one of the finest
amateur productions I've seen,

Staff Explains Trips:
Spirit of New England

by August H, Daviet, Michael L. Lasser, and Frank V, Sperduto

Any attempt at a cohesive understanding of what America {s

must start with an exploration of the environment, history, phys-

fography and literature of New England, One of the first areas of

the North American continent to be formed, New England, many

millions of years later, shared with Virginia the historical limelight
during the colonial period.

Our First Literature

Moreover, these six states gave us our first literature, were
the center of our cultural renaissance in the mid-nineteenth cen-
tury, and are a literary stimulus to this day for poets like Robert
Frost, E.E. Cummings, and Richard Wilbur.

From New England, greatness and nationality grew through
the land “vaguely realizing Westward.” It was Daniel Webster, in
his determination to save the Union in 1850, who sacrificed sec-
tional interests, popularity, and reputation to speak “not as a
Massachusetts man, but as an American.”

Yankee

But there is a distinct New England character. Without resort-
ing to the distortion of the prototype, one can suggest that there
truly does exist the phenomenon of the Yankee — independent,
free, and straight,

Importance of Environment

His land has molded and turned him; how he has acted, in
character and out of it, has been recorded by history; what his
more eloquent neighbors have observed about themselves and their
world is his literary heritage.

Henry David Thoreau, deeply concerned with matters of history
(if distressed by those of politics), and aware of himself as a man
of letters, understood at Walden Pond the vitality and universality
of his natural surroundings. Because this New Englander, who grew
to world stature, understood the play of these three elements within
him, he was a whole man. Our trip will try to emulate the search-
ing spirit of Thoreau, writer, historian, scientist.

Librarian Catalogues
Varied References

by Patricia Drew

During the past school year,—the -Rudolfs Memorial
Library of Rutgers Preparatory School has made great
advances in becoming an excellent library. With the aid
of Mrs. Joan Neuwirth, the librarian, new books have been
added to the library.

All of the books the library had, and new ones re-
ceived, have been catalogued and numbered according to
the Dewey Decimal System. Student librarians, whom Mrs,
Neuwirth thinks have done a wonderful job, helped her
in getting new books ready for general circulation for the
students and faculty. Also, plastic book jackets have been
put on many of the books to protect them and to maintain
their appearance,

 

New Additions

The library has obtained many new books from various
sources. Parents of students in the School have donated
many books to help fill out the collection. Others have
been very generous in their gifts,

Issues of the National Geographic Magazine, dating
back several years, are a notable addition to the library’s
periodical shelf. Dr. Stowe gave
several volumes of history books
to the library, including a set
of American Nation Series and
@ number of Greek and Roman
histories. Foreign language books,
including Spanish and German

novels and poetry, are being] As the school year comes to

readied for the students’ use.
Improved References

The library has many of the
standard reference books for a
high school library. In addition
to the Readers Guide and other
books, two encyclopedias, history
references, and dictionaries for
all of the foreign languages
studied in the School are avail-
able. The poetry, short story,
and genera] Uterature indexes
are in almost constant use.

Work Not Done

The goal is to have the brary

in which it is able to grow.

During the summer, she plans

IN THIS
CORNER

by Dick Patt

This year has definitely been
a memorable one in sports at
Rutgers Prep. The first sign
came during soccer season. After
two ties with Pennington, a 3-0
victory was finally secured at
the hands of Montclair Academy.
This was the soccer team’s first
win in the last five years,

Swimmers Break Even

The swimming team also was
responsible for a praiseworthy
achievement, In just its second
year of competition, It succeeded
in compliling an even record,
3-3-1, Victories over Hun School,
North Pilsinfield, and Newark
Academy highlighted the season.

Baseball Team Wins

Probably the most notable
success was achieved by the
baseball team. Even since a 17-2
romp over Jamesburg in 1957,
the Argonaut nine had suffered
from a victory famine. The first
win almost occured when Prep
faced Dunellen, The Argonauts,
however, lost this closely con-
tested game, 4-3, on a late rally
by Dunellen.

Finally, on May 12, freshman
hurler Mike Jacobs twirled a no-
hitter as Prep rolled to a 7-3
victory over School.
Jacobs struck out seven batters,

nings,. in accomplishing the first.

Potent Offense

Sharing the spotlight with Ja-
cobs in this long awaited victory
was the Prep offense, led by
center fielder Dick Mulligan. He
slammed a double and a triple,
knocking in four runs and scor-
ing one. Ron Rusay and Jacobs
also collected two hits each.

fifth with a base on balls, and Jacobs fol-

a perfect bunt after Young had struck out,

Sutherlin scored and the bases

Mulligan scored on the next
play, giving Prep a five run In-

Jacob’s no-hit effort was backed up by
strong hitting from team captain Dick Mul-

third baseman Pete Konowitz and right
fielder Cal Sutherlin.

VISTT SCHOOL 2 DAYS

November 15,& 16, Rutgers Prep
is going to be evaluated, by the
Commission on #econdary schools,of
The Iiddle Atlantic Association of
Secondary Schools and Colleges. For
thae past eight months Ifr, Shepard
and the faculty, have been working
on school evaluation charts, The
seven man committee will use these
charts as a foundation for their
work, They will visit classes, con-
sult teachers, and students, obs~
erve the office bookeeping,and in-
spect everything that is concerned
with this great school of ours, The
final evaluations of these men will
enable the commission to decide whe
ther Prep will continue to be an
accredited school.

It is customary that secondary
schools become evaluated every ten,
years by men who are advisors in
some capacity of similar schools in
the vicinity.

Remember Prepsters it is to our
advantage to have Prep remain an
accredited school, so let's back
lir, Shppard, and show him the kind
of school we really haves Xomember
they will be here on Monday and
Tuesday of next weeks

ELECTION COMMENT

(Following the example of our
elders), Rutgers Prep voted on
Tuesday Nov. 2, and the result, a
Dewey victory. Hence they joined
the poll takers, political ex-
perts, and newspapors in their
selection.

It is unfortunate that the vote
ers did not agree, if only that we
of a generation who have known
only the Democratic Party being
in power, might. be priviledged to
sample anothcr,

This writer attended the Dowey
rally in Wadison Square Garden,
it was most impressive, and the ,;
governors speech excollent, What
stands out most in my mind is that
at the 6nd of’ it he said," whon
the slection is over let us all
say, ‘this will be good for my
country! ",se..eLet us all hope
that this will be so,

profound thanks.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Sirs:

Remembering the good times we
enjoyed several years ago when
Prep had an organized Theatre Club,
we would like to tell others of . »
some.of the advantages of such a
club. Aside from adding to the
interest of school activities,
good inexpensive seats can be ob-=
tained for many of the current
Broadway shows( without you having
to work for them).

Unfortunately your article did
not include certain necessary det~
ails, If you will give us more in-
formation wo hope that others will
become intcrosted,

Yours, for a thoatre club-

‘+ + Marshall Watts
Angolis Aloxandris
Kearney Kulthau
My. Grove

Through an oversight The Argo
neglectcd to check before last
issue on the cost of a theatre
club, On hearing from llr, Grove,
we can report that tickets can be
obtained for as low as $1.20, and
if 40.boys are intorostod we can
hire a bus, very reasonably, to
take us to and from New York,

We thank the above signed for
thoir interest shown, and urgo
anyone who is intorested in join-
ing a theatre club, to seo Walt
Quim for additional details.

BEWARE! FOR VILLIANS
PROWL THESE HALLS

We of the argo foel that it is
only fair to warn you students
hero at Prep of some of the many
types of pcople that roam those
halls. Perhaps you have already
encountered one or more of thome

First let us examine the case
of tho norvous, frustrated, little
man who scurries about the class
rooms and study halls in a state
of frenzy. One should exert extre
cme caution in dealing with this
type, for, being easily annoyed
by potty things he is apt to wreak
a horrible veangeance, upon those
who dare to breathe while atten-
dence is being taken(during the
first 42 minutes of tho period.)
The latter occurs only in study
hall,

It is not unusual to run acres
oss someone rackling in a chair,
being supported by a doorknob,
amusing himself by drawing tri-~
angles in reverse on the black-
board, and mumbling praises of
the Republican Partye

“o think it's about time to
wind this up, but first let's look
at tho most baffling case of alle
This follow insists upon having
work in on the dote Howover, he
never hands it back, or oven looks
it over until the spirit moves him

Some of the juniors will thank
him for the relatively speedy re-
turn of last years work, He is
quict and almost decont in class,
except for his habit of strolling
around the class juggling chalk,
and participles.

Wo know that hallowoon is over
but..one nover can toll,can ono?

WANTED ARTISTS

Anyone who can draw cartoons or
characters will bo wolcomed to our
staff. How about it, LoBow, Ohrbach

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM
VISITED BY FRESHMAN

Last month a group comprising
the Latin III class and ir.Holleys
Anciont History class, made their
annual tour to New York, and the
jletropolitan lfuseum of art. The
group was transported by chart-
ered bus to the world famous ins-
titution. Unfortunatcly the Greek,
Egyptian, Assyrian, and Babylonian
halls were closed, but Mr. Holley
persuaded the curator, to allow
them to view the Egyptian relics.

After inspecting those oddiment
of ancient Egypt, and dining in
the attractivo museum cafetoria,
the party made a hasty trip to
tho obolisk in Contral Park, Upon
returning to the muscum, and s
searching for information during
the remaining time, the group
boarded the bus, for the return
trip to New Brunswick, thouroughly
saturated with knowledge, about
ancient History. (so Mr. Holly
Hope$).

HILABELPHIA ORCHESTRA'S
SUNDAY CONCERT

Now we have it! More modern mu-
sic at the university concerts!
Lest Sunday's concert by the Phila-
delohia Orchestra was certainly a
jOYe Starting with a beautifully
restrained performance of liozart's
“wine Kleine Nachtmusik, " whose
opening measures had a fullness we
heve never met before, the program
moved “ever upward, ever onward"

One might expect it to be a chore
to listen to a performunce of
Beethomerls oft-repeated Fifth Sym-
phony, but if it is approached as
something fresh ond new, it becomes
an exciting event.

Both the modern works pldyed had
certain qualities in commom. They
both hud, in some places, a hushed,
breathless, suspended-animation
sort of feeling, and in others a
beautiful sheen, which was evident
in the passage for muted violins
in the Ravel suite. Indeed, these
works are by almost exact contem-
poraries, since Ravel was born one
year before Respighi and died one
year later than he. Also, they were
both ‘Latins, though Ravel probably
the more so of the two,

FREEDOM TRAIN

The Freedom Train , the only one
of its kind in the history of Am
erican railroading, paid a visit to
New Brunswick on the 25th of last °:
month. prep went to see the train
at the @reight station, and we were
all quite impressed wwiht what we
sawe There are seven cars to the
train, three of which contain the
documents that tell the story of
our American Heritage,

The Freedom Train has visited
313 American cities since its re-
dedication, and many thousands of
people have seen it. When a visitor
enters the train one of the first
things he sees is the lagna Carta,
one of the foundations of Democracy.

conversion made it 14-7,

The second Prep touchdown was
made by Gumerlock who went around
end after recovering a fumble on
the Fort Washington 22 yard lines

Again it was Fort Washington's
turn to score, and that they did,,
Kemedy took a flat pass from
Heim, and spurted 45 yardse

The second half was dull up

when Fort Washington was forced
deep into their own territory by
a series of penalties, and Gumer=
lock scored the final T.D,. Bill
Lriscoll converted and Prep
won the game 21-20, The margin of

Gumerlock made two of the touch-
downs while the others were made
by John Garboski, and Roy Dill,
Bill lbriscoll made three of the

yards in eight plays with Gumer~-
lock scoring the first of the four
Prep touchdowns,.Bill Driscolls con
version was wide and the score re-
mained at 6-0.

three plays for the second touch-
down. This was done by Gumertock,
and Garboski. Driscoll, again in
form made it 13-0,

Again Prep took the ball, and
because of beautiful blocking on
the line, Dill was able to go over
for the third Prep T.D. Driscoll's
conversion made it 20-0,

very little in the way of gains,
and on third down they were forced
to kick. Tho punt wont to the 41
yard line and Gumerlock ran it
back to the Bordentown 25, It took
Garboski only two plays to score.

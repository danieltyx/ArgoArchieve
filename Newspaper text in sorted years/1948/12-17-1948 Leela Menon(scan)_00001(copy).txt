"A very Merry Christmas and a
Happy New Year," to each and
every one of you. The traditional
time worn greeting gains added
significance every time we say it,
for in a troubled world we have
great need of the Christmas message.

You who go home to warmth and
security are not unaware that less
fortunate fellow men still live in
fear, hunger, and. insecurity.

Let us take our blessings this
Christmas with added awareness that
the Christ child came to bring his
peace to all men everywhere. Let us
do our best: to see that his birth
does mean hope for all mankind.
Goodwill in our hearts toward all
his children will hasten the day
when. the. angels song will be a
reality. "Peace on warth, Good Wial
Toward.Men,, ."

CHRISTMAS MESSAGE

As we go to press with this is-
sue of the Argo, the old town of
New Brunswick is taking on a fese
tive air of Christmas, as are the
neighboring towns, and those thru-
the United States.

The street decorations, the
store windows, the very air of
those who travel on the campus all
remind us that classes will soon
be over and we will all start cel-
ebrating the happiest holiday sea«
son of the year,

Thousands of words will be wri-
tten, thousands of Christmas cards
exchanged, all carrying some sort
of Christmas message. None of them
will be more sincere than the sime
ple wish of the Argo Staff that
each and every one of the students
and faculty will have the finest
Christmas ever,

ad, Note; In this issue of the
Argo, and in subsequent issues we
will have two additional articles,
a full page cartoon section, and
The Argo Spotlight. Je hope that
you will find them interesting.

gentlemen--we hopee-from Prep com=
pined their voices under the dir-

" PREP GRIOMEN FETED

vifty-seven people, including
al Twichell, line coach of Rutgers
University's excellent freshman
football squad, enjoyed the ann-
ual ltutcers Prep father and son
football Banquet, Saturday Dec. 4,
at rrep's George St. dining room.

Varsity certificates were pre-
sented by Coach John Housman to
twenty-five members of the team.
Those who received dertificates
were; Co-captains, Bill Driscoll,
and Dick Gumerlock, Lou Vasvary,
Jim iuoran, Wwike Jensen, Joe Jan-
uszewski, Karl Schreefer, id Or-
lowski, John llgair, Bill Keener,
Tom Beaudette, John Garboski,
Harry liolskow, Jim ufinger, Roy
Dill, Marry Veros, Dick Dunne,
Dick Wikoff, Charles Gorman, Don
aichroth, Marty Jaldman, Charlie
Papp, Stu Jay, Rick Du Brow, and
angelis slexandris. Letters will
be awarded prior to Christmas Vac-
ation.

Hollowing the evening's opening
address by Coach IHousman, Mr,
Shepard enexpectedly distributed
gift certificates foi Mxler's
Men's Store to each memver of the
Little Scarlet, The donations were
the personal gift of an honored
Prep alumnus, now publisher of The
Jew brunswick Daily Home Jews,
ulmer Boyd.

The highlight of the evening's
deliverances was .\l Twichell's
story of a coach who had exclusiv-
ely exploited the word "Champs",

"Cii stood for courage and heart,
a Was for attitude, which the late
Jwntc Rockne said was 755 of the
geome. hi designated manliness; P
was for practice; and S for sac-
rifice, without which no team can
be a winner. Remember;'comented
twichell, "put U in place of A
and you've got chumps, '

Motion pictures of the 1948
rtutgers-princeton grid classic

provided a satisfying finale to
the assemblage,

THE LIU OLD GAMMA HOUSE

As a result of the rugged mil-
itary discipline we of the Gamma
House are vhysically fit, mentally
alert, and the quietest bunch of
rascals you ever did see. But en-
ough of the fruits of life, and
let us venture to see what makes
the house tick.

As you enter the house by way
of the side door, and proceed up
short flight of stairs, you find
yourself in front of a room of hi
social standards. The occupant is
a pleasant person who has a great
knowledge of keeping books and
money straight.( she had better
know some of it is our money).
Leaving lrs. a's room we smell a
curious odor, similar to that of
hard ginger ale, but we can't be su
sure until we peer into the room
on the right and find out,This
room we see is a combination of
an iinglish pub, and an American
museum of art. A figure of stri-
king features is sitting behind
the desk,glasses tied on his head,
and insulting all members of the
human race, except those of a st-
rict British descent,

Having finished the first floor
let us proceed up to the second
and more trouble, in the form of
two jokers to our right, The pl-
easingly plump one, who uses all
the best unglish at the wrong
times is having a wrestling match
with his handsome room mate, the
well known singer of “Cool Water)?!
The next door neighbors are well
known, especially the South amer-
ican wooer of women. His room mate
a tough looking customer, with a
glint in his eye, is hard at work
as unusual, Continuing our sweep
of the second floor, we find a
strange combination in the form
of a red headed sword fighter,
swallower, and teller of tall
tales, is busily telling one to
his room mate, a meek mild indi-
vidual, who sees no evil, speaks
no evil, and hears no evil.

THE DELTA HOUSE IN8C cLICHES

Just to attain some of the spice
of life we would like to view the
Delta House from the top downe

On the third floor exists the
queerest clique the school has ever
witnessed. The members of the cli-
que are the chief exponents of the
three B's of life...Bo0ze, Butts,
and Babes..Its instigator, and pre
esident by unanimous vote is "Shae
key" Livingood. Conforming in Zome-
bie like fashion are Jensen, Jays
and "Hnu-u-u~-0-0-0" Opdyke. Buried
emid mountains of paint and plas-
ter, the artistic Beaujon, produce
es modern art,.skulls, rummies, and
shmoos. And just plain hermetici-
zing is sbert Henriques, who occ-
asionally descends to the basement
to wrench Chopin from a strictly

"bop" piano.

The second floor is most easily
divided into pairs. Rovine and Da
nna collect punk jokes, demerits,
and complimentary tickets to the
impromptu performances of the third
floor. liiske and Marascio altera-
tely build and destroy model air
planes, wiseman and Birnbaum, out
do each other in loud ties and p” ~
tical jokes. llr. Grove, and I'r.
Steinway are colleagues in chaos.
Gorman and jr, Grove's guitar pla-
ing are engaged in combat to see
who will crack first.

THOSE FRESHMAN-WOW

If a stranger ever conceived the
idea of visiting the Freshman ut
Prep, the stupidity of ever having
thought of such a thing would hit
him as soon as he opened the door
of room two.

Directly to his right, he would
see a bean pole fully eight feet
tall, pushed down into a seat, and

second Holley, tortures his recruits reglining ype eer ee

with his dust detector at inspec-
tion time, but always manages to
save the best seats in his telev-
ision emporium for his boys. Hines
has very nobly devoted himself to
teaching his Dutch room mate the
american Slanguage, Hans devotes
himself to finding electrical sp-
lices to swaddle in miles of tape,
vurtzel and Turdo run around sea-
rehing with axes for atoms to sp-
lit, so they can get some heat.In
conclusion we might mention, that
the basement is inhabited by,the
eighth wonder of the world, the
coke machine, a mole hole used as a
dark room, two discordant pianos
and one dead furnace, '

by the name George, he would stir,
open his eyes, and grunt question-
ingly. Across the room is a much
pulkier object, carefully flexing
his muscles, and making queer sou-
nds, his name might be Irwin. Back
in the first corner, we will no
doubt find a hecp of muscles, mun-
ching on a triple decker sandwich,

een more of these creations, but

There is basketball in the air
everywhere in the country. and jsut
as other schools, Rutgers rrep has
begun to prepare for the difficult
season which lies ahead,

Liv. Blake as you know is the J.
Ve. coach, He is doing a very good
job with the limited time available
to him and should have a fast,
flashy, five ready in the near fut-
ures

among the boys out for J.V. ball
are: Charles Gorman, Richard Sere

Bill Fox, Ray Henderson, Irwin
Roth, Tom Lurray, Charles Tucker,
George Pauk, Jack Castles, Ben
Vlein, Neal Macfarlan, Francis
Stokes, Charles Jaquart, John
John ifiske, Lou Fedor, Jack And-
erson,

If the boys live up to expect-
ations, ir. Blake stated that in
the near futue, boys other than
the first five will see action.
Let's back our team and make it
a habit to be at all games.

In the debut of the J.V. tean,
only the first five men played,
and Prep won by a score of 37-24,

The reason for using only five
men was the fact that lir. Blake
wanted to give his first team some
action so that they would be ready
for the tough game with Highland

The J.V. team did not look at

PIVE STUPS TO BUTTSR OUTDOOR PHOTOGRAPHY

Page 7

Getting of to the right start with a new camera is just
a matter of remembering five simple, yet important steps--little
things that mean the difference between taking a poor picture and a

good one,.

STuP ONE, is to aim the camera
accurately, Sharpness and clarity
mean little if the subject has
been scalped by careless sighting.
Getting all of the subject within
the camera's field is easy if you
proportion the subject to fit the
film so-to-speak, The closer you
are to the subject the more exact-
ing you must be aiming, Nake it a
practice to always check the top,
sides, and bottom of the sight pic-
ture and see that a margin exists
all around the subject,

STup T/O, is focusing. Focusing
becomes more critical as you app-
roach the subject. At a distnace
of 16ft. you can be off focus by
as much as 6in, without it show-
ing up in the sharpness of the
picture, . six inch discrepency at
a distance of 4 feet, however, will
result in a very blurred picture,
Camera's with coupled range fin-
ders and ground-glass viewers take
the guess work out of focusing,.

STuP Tiwi, calls for lighting
the subject. A good rule to foll-
ow here is to shoot with the sun
at your back. When photographing
a person or group of people, how-
ever, do not have them face dir-
ectly into the sun, A bright but
overcast day eliminc.tes the shad-
ow problem, and is generally con-
sidered the best type of day for
average shooting,

The application of the preceding
during your Schristmas Holiday will

of pictures which will constitute a
Vacation,

STuP FOUR, is getting the right
exposure, \/hen the aperature is
small a camera increases the depth
of focus, and overcomes to a cert-
ain degree, loss of detuil through
error in focusing. In recucing the
size of the aperature, the amount
of light that can enter the shutt-.
er is being reduced,. also this me-.
ans that the picture must be taken
at a slower shutter speed to com-
pensate for this. Other factors

that enter in determinin hutter
speed are the degree of Bokion

to be stopped, and the speed rat-
“ing of the film,

Shutter and speed aperature are
most easily determined with a ph-
oto electric exposure meter, alth-
ough any of the printed exposure

guides available will give good ree
sults..

STxP FIVi, hold the camera steady,
A tripod is the best means for sup
porting a camera, but this is not
always feasable, so you should ad-
opt the practice of bracing the

elbows against the body, and hold-
ing your breath momentarily as the
picture is taken. The slower the

shutter speed, the more chance th-

ere is for camera movement when
held by hand,

Ye Dial Goes To
Press; Yearbook
Expected May 29

YE DIAL having already gone to
press, it is now hoped that it may be
ready for release about May 29.
The page proofs came about May Ist;
the last of the engravings had
sent to the printers about April 24.
The identifications for the candid
camera pictures, of which there are
to be eight full pages in the finished
product, were written by ob
Schweitzer and Fred Lambert. The
Whole makeup of the yearbook has been
changed since last year. Among other
things done, an introductory page for
cach section of the book, an innovation
new this year, has, been planned, and
titles have been written for every P
in the publication, The writing of
these has been ably carried on by both
Editor-in-chief David French and by

Bob Beaudette.

 

  
   
  

 

 

  

      

 

 

 

    

 

   

  

 

Mr. Hunter, staff advisor from the
faculty, when interviewed about the
DIAL, said, “I believe that the year-

book will be better this year than for
several seasons previously, One rea-
son for this is that the organization o
the book has been planned and thought
out by the DIAL staff, not left to the
choice and fancy of a much rushed
printer. Also, the fact that cooperation
between the staff and the editors has
been excellent will undoubtedly prove
influential in the success of the volume.”

The printing is being done by the
I. N. Blue Company, who also print
the school newspaper. Pictures of the
various school organizations were taken
by Lorston-Thomas, the school’s pho-
tographers.

David French, the editor, when asked
how the yearbook was progressing.

HOTEL PARTY NOT
SCHOOL SPONSORED

The recent announcement in as-
sembly that there is to be a Rutgers
Prep party at the Hotel Astor in
New York City on the night of June
5th has caused some confusion in
the minds of the students and par-
ents. The announcement was made
without consulting Mr. Shepard. As
the dance is taking place after the
close of school and as no members
of the faculty will be present, it

 

 

should be understood by all con-
cerned that the school is not spon-
soring the party.

 

 

 

JUNIORS ASSUME
ARGO EDITORSHIP

As has been the custom during, the
past several years, the Senior editors
bf the ARGO have again turned over
the management of the final issue of
the paper to members of the Junior
class. With such a large number o!
the constituents of the present staff
graduating this June, it has been
thought best that the incoming editors
be given ample opportunity to display
their abilities and gain the necessary
experience for the part which they are
to play next fall. Int way, aspir-
ants for the ARGO may compete for
positions open on the editorial and
business boards.

Bill Okerson and Ed Burroughs are
serving as co-editors of the last appear-
ance of the ARGO this year. They
have taken charge of the allo t and
collection of assignments, as
many as possible to those Juniors who
will be members of the staff next year.
In addition, Burroughs and Okerson
are largely responsible for the writing
of the headlines and the composition

THE LAST ONE

This edition of the ARGO, number seven of volume four, is the
last one of the year, Since it marks the end of a successful literary
year at Rutgers Prep, we hope you will find it the best issue of the
year.
The fact that this is the last issue probably rings a bell in the
minds of many students, the sound being both sweet and sour. It
signifies that vacation is just around the corner—always a sweet
sounding note—as well as indicating that the final examinations are
approaching with the speed of “Whirlaway fact which is as
welcome as a blow-out. However, some consolation lies in the fact
last only a week, while vacation is more than three months.

ace this is the last issue of the year, we feel that due respect
should be paid to its editors, Bob Beaudette, Dave French, and Rex
Miller, as well as to Mr. Hunter, the ARGO advisor. It should be
noted that, although Mr. Hunter had no connection with our paper
before this year, he took it over and produced the favorable results
found in past issu However his newspaper career will probably be
cut short, since he has registered in the recent draft. Also, the busi-
n and editorial boards should receive praise. Those on the business
board made the ARGO possible by securing advertisements, while,
through the editorial board, the school news was collected and
published.

Thus, with June fourth only eleven school days away, there will
he no time to devote to the ARGO. Consequently this issue termi-
nates the year’s editions, but next year, priorities permitting, the
ARGO will again appear in the hands of students of Rutgers Prep.

   

    

 

   

    

 

  

   

IS IT FAIR?

As the school year draws to a close, and the weather turns from
warm, to hot, to melting, that the pace of study is accelerated? Why is
it, students ask, that when their fancy turns and spring fever weakens
them and the beautiful days urge them to forsake their books, the
granite hearted teachers cram more and more knowledge into brains
already over-taxed.

Since everyone knows that it is harder to study in springtime, why
do the teachers force more chemistry, mathematics, history and other
subjects on the unwilling minds of their students. In spring there are
also many extra-curicula activities, such as baseball tennis, golf or
sleeping to take up all of the pupil's time. But still it’s study, study,
study. That seems to be the only thing that teachers think of. Have
they a one track mind? ‘ime after time the students plead with the
masters for less homework, but no. And as the spring draws on the
pupils daily suffer more and more until it is almost unbearable, or so
they believe. .

“But there's another side to this story—the teacher's. He knows
that it's his duty to force enough knowledge into the stubborn heads
of his pupils in order that they can pass the course for the year. He
realizes that to earn his salary honestly, he must make his pupils
work. Although the students believe that it’s unfair, the masters are
actually doing everything to benefit the student.

This being the case, it is the duty of every bo
off the spring laziness and to concentrate on de
the final examinations.

THE BOOKWORM =. .- -

CROSS CREEK
by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings
new book by the
YEARLING, the best seller of
ar or so ago ,in my mind surpasses
even her earlier success. There is a
certain quict charm, a certain air of
peace and understanding companion-
ship to the tale which endears it to
the reader immediately,

It is the story of the author's life in
a small Florida settlement, Cross Creek.
Since there are only five families of
whites and about the same number of
Negroes living there, it is what one
might tritely term “a big happy family.”
Whenever one person is sick or in
trouble, the others always “come
through.” When Miss Rawlings was
away on a trip one year, a severe frost
struck the section of the country where
she lived. She naturally feared for the
safety of her orange trees, which she
had left completely unprotected, but
upon returning, she found that a neigh-
bor had very carefully piled protection
of one sort or another around each
tree. Consequently, not a one had
been injured.

Perhaps the feature of the little set-
tlement most novel to our suspicious
city cars is the entire lack of dishonesty.
When one goes away on a trip, he
naturally es the front door un-
locked without a single thought on the
matter. When a person wants an
art from his neighbor's tool shed,
he usually just walks in and takes it
without another thought, returning it
as quietly some days, months, or years
later. For if Jones wants a hoe, he
will take Smith's, but this is perfectly
all right because Smith most likely
has Jones's hatchet laying around any-
way. Thus the community works on
a complete trust basis which operates
for the good of all. Also, if someone
takes a bit of gasoline from a neigh-
bor's tractor for his own use, it is very
probable that a week or so later he
will receive a mysterious gift of a
bunch of freshly caught fish to make

up for it. In fact, the only crimes
in the territory consist of periodic
drunken orgies participated in by

Negroes on pay day. And even these
are sometimes treated with a distinct-
ly homespun meeting out of justice.
When Henry shoots Sambo by mis-
take at a rather exciting party, neither
afterward hold grudges, nor does the
law do absolutely nothing about it.
In one case, Miss Rawlings describes
a case within her own experience where
no one would have ¢ noticed the
affair if it had not been for her stub-
born persistence. Even then, she was
forced to let the matter drop when a
delegation of neighbors, headed by the
n, begged her “to let the things

 

 

  

Miss Rawlings claims that her great-
est dread in going to the South had
been snakes. According to the books
she had read, it was impossible to
move two feet without being attacked
by at least two copperheads and a
water snake, while the creatures actual-
ly spent their time looking for peaple

MUCH PROMISE SHOWN
IN PRACTICE GAMES

In the course of the baseball season
the Prep nine has played a series o}
practice games for the purpose of ob-
taining additional experience and giving
a chance to substitutes, who might not
otherwise play in a game.

The first of these games was with the
Rutgers Freshmen on the University
diamond. It proved a disastrous be-
ginning as the Prep pitching staff was
pounded for eleven runs. Al ans
had the experience of pitching against
his brother Bill, who graduated from

SOUTH RIVER NINE DOWNS PREP, 8 TO 2;
WIGHT CLOUTS HOME RUN; LINDER HURLS

The Prep baseball squad made its
second start of the season against the
South River High School nine at South
River, and suffered a 8-2 defeat at the
hands of a fast-playing high school

 

team. The three hit pitching of Bob
Snure held the Prep nine in check,
while the South River team drove

across seven runs,

_Prep scored first in the second in-
ning. Howie Woodruff was hit by a
pitched ball, and after George Mederer
had flyed out, he stole second. Bob
Plitt grounded to Hydrusko at short,
who threw to third, but too late to
catch Woodruff. Toth was safe on
Hydrusko's error, as Woodruff scored,
Conhagen and Evans popped up in or-
der to end Prep’s half of the inning.
Sierotko promptly tied the score with
a long home run over Woodruff’s head
in left field.

_Neither team scored again until the
sixth inning, when South River shoved
across two runs on singles by Gorman
and Wilk, helped by three errors on the
part of Prep.

Three more runs crossed the plate
for South River in the seventh inning,
as Kumba walked and stole second.
Cereguash grounded to Linder, who
caught Kumba off second; but Kumba
got back, sliding past the short-stop.

 

  

 

 

Gorman singled, scoring Kumba._ Sie-
rotko struck ow! Salomon and Snure
walked, forcing a run. Wilk sin-
gled, driving in two more, but he was
caught sliding into third, ending the
inning.

Phil Wight, who replaced Toth in
the fifth, led off in the eighth inning
and connected for a sizzling liner down
the first base line past the right fielder
for a home run, This concluded the
scoring for Prep.

_ Bob Clothier, who pitched the last
inning for Prep, retired the side in
short order. Since Prep was unable
to score in the ninth, the game ended

Tennis Team’s
Softball Nine
Nips Day Boys

The temporarily defunct Tennis
Team's softball nine engaged a group
i ly known

of Day Boys, as
the Beaudette Boobs, (and they are,
too), in a very informal game on the
diamond beside the Delta House two
weeks ago. After a five-inning tussle,
if we may call it such, the Tennis Team
emerged victorious, shading the Day
Boys, 16 to 4.

The final result of the game was
rarely ever in doubt, the issue being
decided, as a matter of fact, after the
Tennis Team had batted for the first
time. In the first inning, Bob Nafey
fell down while attempting to catch
Charlie Meissner’s fly ball, which ended

 

    

  

 

up in George Street as a four-run
homer. ‘rom that time on, the Day
Boys’ playing varied from bad to worse,

at least every member of the team com-
mitting one error with the exception
of Hank Carbonell, who was drafted
from the Boarding School and placed
in right field. The Tennis Team con-
tinued to score with four runs in each
the second and third as such stars as
“Killer” Kenlan and “Socko” Sexton
hit consistently.

Houses Compete In
Softball at Traps

Soft ball has now taken its place in
the ranks of athletics at Rutgers Prep.
Every afternoon at 3:00 o'clock sharp,
a soft ball game is begun,

Since the proposed tennis team was
never made up, soft ball has now taken
the place of tennis. Soft ball, ina way,
is cheaper to play than hard ball. For
instance, soft ball is usually not played
with gloves, although they may be
used. Also, soft ball can be played
on a smaller or in a more confined
place than hard ball. This, limitation
makes it just right for playing on the
field next to the Delta House.

Every boarding boy must go out for
one sport or another; tennis, golf, base-
ball, or softball, Of course, horseshoes
may be played, though not_as a sub-
stitute for a regular sport. Since there
will be no tennis team this year, tennis,
like horseshoes, will be a recreation at
Prep. A large number of boys are go-
ing out for golf, baseball, and tennis;
even so, soft ball will be one of the
main sports.

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Scotch Plains Loses
To Prep’s Golfers
As Williams Stars

May 13 the Rutgers Prep golf team
traveled to Plainfield for its second
i out of three matches, defeating
the Scotch Plains team 10-2 on a wind-
swept caurse. All four of the Prep
golfers won their respective matches
although a stiff wind hampered play;
except for the wind the day was perfect
for golf and the course was in fine
shape.

Dan Williams, Prep’s mighty mite,
kept up his perfect record of three wins
and no losses by defeating Bill Marko,
Scotch Plains number one man. Danny
set the pace from the first tee to the
eighteenth green, winning in good
ashion. Playing his usual _ brilliant
game, Danny won both the first nine
and the last nine by identical scores
three up and two to go. (3-2).

The number two match was m
by sharp rivalry between Jerry T
of Prep and Fred McCrea of Scotch
Plains. Having halved the first round,
Jerry came back in the second round
and blasted his way back to win the

ch three up.

This match was interesting because

it was a nip and tuck battle all the

DANNY WILLIAMS WINS
IN PEDDIE TOURNEY

A contest for some of New Jersey
Private Schools, took place at the Ped-
die School in Hightstown, New Jersey,
May 9th. Those schools represented
were Peddie School, Blair Academy,
Newman School, Montclair Academy,
Pennington School, and Rutgers Prep
School. This ch was the Golf
‘Tournament Head Master and Coaches
Association of New Jersey.

The two top golfers Merritt and
Clarke, both of these golfers shot an
78. Dan Williams of Prep tied two
other Peddie men with an 80. There
was a draw for the medal, but_Dan
lost. Of most importance, was Dan’s
sinking a putt on the eighteenth green,
thus giving him a birdie 4, which
quallifed him for the draw. — Jerry
Taub and Bob Schweitzer both lost,
thus disqualifying them from the
awards

The course was an exceptionally in-
teresting one with a par 73 for the
eighteen, The tournament was very
well managed under the supervision of
Mr. William Boyd, Peddie School's
golf coach.

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

    

 
  

 

 

 

  

 

 

Lawrenceville Nips
Prep, 6 to 4, in
Tightly-played Tilt

Prepsters Outhit Winners, 6-4,
But Laurentians Capitalize
On Breaks To Conquer

Taking an carly lead which they
held throughout’ the game, the
Lawrenceville baseball nine delivered
Prep its third consecutive defeat by a
6-4 score at Lawrenceville. The game
was closely contested all the way with
good pitching on both sides. Bob Plitt
slapped out two hits for Prep while
Dulcan did the same for Lawrenceville.

The opposing squad got rolling in
the first inning when Dulcan beat out
an infield single and went to second on
Deflinger’s sacrifice bunt. Logan was
safe on an infield error, and stole sec-
ond, putting men on second and third.
Here Benedict hit a double down the
third-base line, scoring two men.

It wasn’t until the fourth inning that
scored. George Mederer was
s ulcan’s error and went to
third when the ball got away from the
catcher. He scored on Linder’s
grounder to second base. Lawren!
ville came back in the same inning,
scoring two runs on two errors, a walk,
and a trip! In the fifth inning the
Lawrenceville boys pushed across one
more run when Logan ched_ first
safely on an error, stole second and
went to third on an infield out. Biggs
singled to center and Logan

Bob Clothier replacing Johnny
Linder on the mound retired the side.

Prep rallied in the top of the sixth
vans singled to center and was
fe at second as Davis played George
Mederer’s grounder to the keystone
sack but missed putting the base run-
ner out. Prep then pulled a success-
ful double steal. Evans scored 3
Havens hit a fly to deep left, and Linder
followed with a single to score Mederer.

Lawrenceville scored once

Linksmen Triumph
Over Hun Golfers

_ The first golf match of the season
for Rutgers Prep was held on home
territory with the Hun School. It was
interesting match, because the
players were evenly paired. Dan Wil-
liams, Prep’s number one man, came
through with an 81 for the eighteen,
and his opponent, I ickson, 86,
Jerry Taub playing second man topped
with a 95 his opponent, Dan Bolen,
who came through with 98. Playing
in third position was Bob Schweitzer
with a 101, His opponent David Hol-
man, made a 104. orace Hesson,
number four man, lost to Arthur O'Neil
with a 117, bowing to Art's 111.

Dan Williams was really “on” dur-
ing the whole match, sinking putts and
laying out drives as only a pro can
do. He proved to be stiff competition
for Frank Erickson, who the “Prep
Four” bow to fine sportsman and
a very promising golfer. how-
ever, claims that he always plays ac-
cording to his competition, and he cer-
tainly did a good job. Bob and Hor-
ace, playing the second match, had a
close second nine, the ch finally
ending in their favor.

As all had a fine day and enjoyed
the match immensely, they are looking
forward to another game with the Hun
Four before the season closes.

War Sees Alumni
Active In Many
Service Fields

Farley Receives Honors At
Dartmouth; Hale Tries
For Air Corps Job

Because of the war and its affiliated
industries, there has been a great boom
in jobs and positions in the armed
forces. Since this has naturally affected
a great many of the students and alumni
oi the Rutgers Preparatory school, it
seems only fitting to recapitulate some
of the activities ot our ex-students.

Harry Garey, whom some will re-
member from last year's seniors, is
now at the University of Georgia,
where he 1s specializing in the agri-
cultural division. In a recent letter to
Mr. Shepard he mentioned that the
work in the College of Arts and Sci-
ences is quite casy after preparation
at Rutgers Prep, but that the chem-
istry of agriculture is quite a different
matter. He has to work very hard
even to get by in these courses. Ap-
parently he is taking a speeded course
of studies, for he states that he is
now carrying five courses which keep
him more than busy.

Lauric Farley, who was graduated
from this school in 1940, is one of forty
in a class of six hundred sophomores
elected to the Green Key, an honorary
society for Juniors at Dartmouth, ‘This
is indeed an honor.

Henry Martyn Hale has recently
applied for a transcript of his grades
in regard to entering the Army Air
Force in the Aviation Cadet Section.
He is only one of the many boys who
have applied for such transcripts: a

great number of our graduates are join-
ing the armed forces in one branch
or another. And speaking of Harry

a time with spinal menigitis, having
been in the Naval Tospital, but seems
to be making a satisfactory conva-
lescence.

 

 

COLLEGE APPLICATIONS

scholastic aptitude or achievement tests,
have not yet been received by the
seniors. Some of them, however, have
been sent notices, stating that their

certain not to receive the consideration

Since the chosen colleges of those
seniors, who have not already sub-
mitted application blanks, will swell

the number of universities which sen-
iors will attend, it is safe to say that
Rutgers Prep seniors will be scattered
throughout the nation this summer and
fall.

INTRA-MURAL BASEBALL
(Continued from Page 3)

The Day Boys had a much harder
time scoring, finding the Tennis Team's
defenses somewhat better. DeHosson
and Odell did do some continual drop-
ping of double play balls around sec-
ond base and Vogelsang batted out of
turn once to hit a three-run home
run, but that was about all

Harry Cohen pitched a good game
for the Tennis Team while Beaudette,

i , and Howell twirled for the
Mr. Shepard umpired most
until he forgot it was
na left. Max Raab and Tom-

Bishop reluctantly finished the
duties of arbitration.

 

 

 

 

 

   

THE ARGO

Many Students To
| Spend Summer In
Work On Defense

Sturomberg-Carlson Plant
Claims Hancock; Starr
Plans Ranch Work

 

As the summer vacation comes nearer
and nearer many of the students have
1 or are attempting to get jobs to
y the long hours; besides they

use the extra pecuniary reimburse-
ment that they will receive for their
abors. It is standard practice for the
managers of summer hotels to employ
prep and college students as bell-hops,
bus-boys, waiters during the sum-
mer. This affords the student a vaca-
tion at some famous resort as well as
giving him a chance to earn part of
his school expenses for the following
year. Our students are no different.
Many are applying for employment and
several have already secured positions.
But this year, due to the war, jobs are
more varied and plentiful,

Bill van der Mculen is going to pass
his vacation deep in the heart of a
New York park. He'll be on a park
patrol occupied by passing the time
strolling through the shady woods.

Johnny Starr is going out to Wyom-
ing to work on a ranch, How much
work he'll do is hard to guess . It’s
frankly hard to imagine Johnny as a
rip-roaring, gun-toting cowboy, but
he'll certainly look adorable in a ten-
gallon hat and chaps.

But the majority of jobs this year
will be in defense industries which are
absorbing all the man and woman
power that the army or the bonds of
matrimony haven't beaten them to.
Harold Hancock is one of, the many
boys who will find a place in industry
this summer. He is going to work in
Stromberg-Carlson plant which

This summer more than any other,
boys of high school and college age
will be found working in almost every

vacation

line of employment. It is a credit to
the American boy that when the army
depletes the man power of the coun
try, he takes over when he is able and
endeavors to do the job.

HOWELL WINS AWARD
IN RIFLE CONTEST

 

Senior Prep student Fred Howell of
Highland Park won the Second Junior
Award of the National Rifle Associa-
tion He is the first Junior contestant.

Fifty shots were required in all the
different shooting positions; neverthe-
less he hit the bulls-eye, which is no
larger than a caliber cartridge,
cighty percent of the time at a distance
of fifty feet

The contest, which was held at vari-
ous times over a period of weeks at
the Rutgers Gym, was under the super-
vision of Capt. Robert B. Johnson, the
rifle team coach.

When nineteen, Fred will compete to
capture the Distinguished Rifleman
Gold Bar. Anticipating a cartridge
shortage, Fred has laid in a suffcient
supply of bullets to last some time.

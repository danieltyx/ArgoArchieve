Ar the meeting of the Athletic Association
the attendance was small. There have as yet
only ten men joined the Association, which is
a poor showing. During the foot-ball season
there were enrolled about twenty. The condi-
tions make it all the more desirable to join,
apart from a sense of loyalty to the school.
Whoever pays the admission fee is entitled to
see all the games of the school in this city free
of charge. We would urge every one to be-
come a member of the A. A.

Tue cheering in the game with Plainfield
High School was remarkably good. Good, *
loud, lusty cheering goes a long way to en-
courage the players. It shows them that a
large number of the spectators are in sympa-
thy with them. It causes them to put forth
their best efforts, and to “put up” the best
game possible. It would be a good thing if
the boys of the school would always do as
much cheering as possible, and thus, though
they may not be on the team, help to win vic-
tories for the old school.

Tue Delta Theta dance was as great a suc-
cess as that held last year. The former time it
was held in the Mansion House, on Albany
street, but this time Dr. and Mrs. Payson were
kind enough to lend the “Trap” for the pur-
pose. The whole affair was managed very
well, and the three hustling committeemen de-
serve the thanks of the many who passed the
evening so pleasantly.

Tue appearance of the military company of
Rutgers Prep. was excellent at the exhibition
drill of the Rutgers Corps Cadets. The ushers
were strict in the performance of their duties,
and the others at guard duty were also assidu-
ous. Mr. Nuttman has been well rewarded for
all the pains he has been put to in making the
company what it is.

Tue base-ball nine thus far has made an ad-
mirable showing. The scores were bad in no
case, and were very good for the most part.

practicing every afternoon, and they seem to
be steadily improving.

Tue two plays presented. before the public

on the evening of May 11, were certainly a
great success. This happy result was due in
great part to the untiring attention of Mr. Ells-
ler. Mrs. Payson and Miss Strong assisted a
great deal in the selection of costumes, especi-
ally of the fair damsels (pro tem). The boys
themselves who took part, had to give a good
deal of time and study. The financial part of
this entertainment was admirably conducted
by Mr. R. Hude Neilson. The proceeds are
said to exceed those of last year.
es

THE DRAMATIC ENTERTAINMENT.

The auditorium of the Y. M. C. A. Hall was
well filled with a select audience on the evening
of May 11. The expectations of the multitude
of seeing a good performance were fully real-
ized, as shown by the frequent applause. The
plays started shortly after the scheduled time,
8.15 o'clock.

The first play, entitled “Sir Hippington Miff,
or The Purchase of the Bond,” was rather a
heavy tragedy, intermixed with considerable
comedy. The plot was as follows:

Sir H. Miff, traveling in France, happens to
engage lodgings in the Parisian House of
Captain Bonassus, who has fled from home
with his companion Babillard, to escape pay-
ment of a bond for twenty thousand francs,
which bond Sir H. Miff holds. -Drouet, ex-
lieutenant and former friend of the Captain,
attempts to get possession of the bond and re-
lieve Bonassus. De Cachet, Minister of Police,
is on the track of Drouet. Matters are still
further complicated by Bromo, Sir H. Miff’s
valet, accidentally drinking a sleeping potion,
not intended for him, and the unsuspected re-
turn of the Captain, finding Sir H. Miff in-
stalled in his home, brings matters to a climax.
The difficulties are intensified by Sir H. Miff's
ungrounded suspicions and Madame Pelagie’s
importunity for Sir H. Miff’s comfort.

Captain Bonassus was a very stern and fear-
fully bewhiskered old man, of a very uncertain
temper. His comrade-at-arms, Bombadier

_ Babillard, was a much younger man who had

 

the military carriage of a veteran, as indeed he
was. He had, with his captain, taken part in
two battles, in which the brave couple had
“retreated gloriously,” as Captain B. explained.
Vincent Dorville was the ideal lover, hand-
some as a spring chicken. When he kissed
pretty Miss Antoinette, no doubt the fair ones
of the audience envied the young lady, though
they applauded vigorously. Sir H. Miff, from
whom the play took its name, was the principal
character in it. He was a melancholy English-
man, and played the part to perfection. Bromo
was the funny man; he gave all the latest (?)
jokes, which brought the house down. Drouet
was a typical villain. De Cachet was a French
minister of police, and looked much like a
French officer with his imperial and mustache.
Gregory made an excellent “pig-killer,” with
his sleeves rolled up and a knife as long as his
arm. Antoinette was a pretty girl, who blushed
as was fitting when kissed so openly by her
lover. Madame Pelagie was an old lady full
of dignity of bearing. Bombadier was a fool
not to accept her hand, so kindly offered to
him by her brother, Captain Bonassus.

There was an intermission of fifteen minutes
between the plays, during which time the au-
dience was favored by a violin solo by Mr.
Louis Bevier, which was encored. Then came
the far-famed “Dance of the Rookies,” in which
Messrs. Verdi, Corbin and Williamson made a
hit.

The next play was a lighter and*funnier one.
There were only five participants. The play
was called “The Gentleman and the Valet, or

 
THE ARGO. 119

The Maid and the Mistress.” The audience
was constantly in laughter. The plot was:
Mr. Brambleton, expecting the arrival of a
model young bachelor, to whom he is about to
marry his daughter Cicely, and having en-
gaged a new man servant for the same day,
gets the man servant and the “bachelor” hope-
lessly confused, owing to his forgetfulness of
names. In the meantime, Mr. Swanhopper,
the model young bachelor, and Lavender, the
servant—the one having come too late, the

other too early—mistake the maid servant,’

Matilda, for the daughter, Cicely, and unac-
countable complications ensue.

Mr. Simonides Swanhopper was a very sen-
timental, melo-dramatic young man.  Law-
rence Lavender was a truly helegant English
“waly-de-sham.” Mr. Bloomfield Brambleton
was an irascible old man, and made a very good
one. Cicely made a pretty girl, likely to capti-
vate any heart, as it did poor Simonides’. Ma-
tilda Jane was a fine servant girl. Mr. Buttler
has acted in that capacity before, and as usual
was a great success. Characters:

Lawrence Lavender....... ose, wasn Mr. Ashley

After the performance the “company” had
its picture taken by Mr. Dodge.

The ushers were: Mr. Neilson, Mr. Voor-
hees, Mr. Woodbridge, and Mr. Weed.

THE DELTA THETA DANCE.

On the evening of Friday, May roth, one of
the most successful social events of the season
occurred. This was the dance given at the
“Trap” by the Delta Theta Fraternity. The
guests began to assemble shortly before eight
o'clock. The dancing was kept up until nearly
one. The floor of the dining room was in
prime condition. The rooms ‘were prettily
decorated with dogwood and other wild flow-
ers, which the very energetic members of the
Fraternity gathered. The ceiling of the dining
room, in which the dancing was held, was dec-

orated with red bunting. In the music room
there was a large bowl of lemonade, which had
to be refilled several times. The dancing or-
ders were very pretty. Upon the outside there
was the monogram of the Fraternity in gold
and red. Upon one of the walls was hung the
emblem of the Fraternity. Hart furnished the
music. There were twenty dances, besides the
extras. The supper, which was served at about
cleven o'clock, consisted of remarkably good
ice cream and cake. The guests began to dis-
perse about a quarter before one.

The patronesses who were so kind as to aid
the boys were: Mrs. Payson, Mrs. Benedict,
Mrs. DeMott, Mrs. Kip, Mrs. Labaw, Mrs.
Pettit, Mrs. Scott, Mrs. Van Dyck, Mrs. Voor-
hees, Mrs. Williamson, and Mrs. Woodbridge.
Among the members of the Fraternity present
were Messrs. Benedict, Mason, Voorhees,
Nafey, Kip, Labaw, Little, Edgar, Pettit,
Woodbridge. The committee consisted of Mr.
Benedict, Mr. Labaw, and Mr. Kip.

Among those present were: Miss Kip, of
Passaic, N. J.; Miss Edgar, Miss Ayres, Miss
Thomas, Miss Benner, of Metuchen; Misses
Helen Smith, Sarah DeMott, Helen Howell,
Abbie Howell, Florence Irwin, Daisy Neilson,

THROUGH A WINDOW IN BRUNS-
WICK.

Two matters in particular have engaged the
thoughts of almost every one during the past
winter. One is the investigation about Army
affairs; the other is the unusual prévalence of
colds. But matters of that sort occupied the
attention of other generations before ours.
An extract from the works of John Adams,
which has often been quoted here in New
Brunswick, will bear quoting again, if only
for the benefit of our younger readers. Benja-
min Franklin, and Edward Rutledge, of South
Carolina, and John Adams, of Massachusetts,
were appointed a commission to treat with the
British commander, and on their way, on the
night of September 9, 1776, they spent the
night in New Brunswick. The inn at which
they lodged was the “Indian Queen,” which is
no longer standing, but which was situated on
Albany street near the Raritan River bridge,
and which was kept by James Drake, who,
twenty-one years afterward, sold a pair of
horses to Adams the week before his inaugu-
ration as President of the United States.

We give below the words of John Adams
about the soldiers and his discussion with
Franklin about the cause of colds, as recorded
in Adams’s autobiography.

“On this day Mr. Franklin, Mr. Edward
Rutledge, and Mr. John Adams, proceeded on
their journey to Lord Howe, on Staten Island,
the two former in chairs, and the latter on
horseback. The first night we lodged at an
inn in New Brunswick. On the road, and at
all the public houses, we saw such numbers of
officers and soldiers, straggling and loitering,
as gave me, at least, but a poor opinion of the
discipline of our forces, and excited as much
indignation as anxiety. Such thoughtless dis-
sipation, at a time so critical, was not calcu-
lated to inspire very sanguine hopes, or give
great courage to ambassadors. I was, never-
theless, determined that it should not dis-
hearten me. I saw that we must, and had no
doubt but we should, be chastised into order
in time.

THE ARGO.

“The taverns were so full we could with
difficulty obtain entertainment. At Bruns-
wick, but one bed could be procured for Dr.
Franklin and me, in a chamber little larger
than the-bed, without a chimney, and with
only one small window. The window was
open, and I, who was an invalid and afraid of
the air in the night, shut it close. ‘Oh!’ says
Franklin, ‘don’t shut the window; we shall be
suffocated.’ I answered, I was afraid of the
evening air. Dr. Franklin replied, ‘The air
within this chamber will soon be, and indeed is
now, worse than that without doors. Come,
open the window and come to bed, and I will
convince you. I believe you are not acquainted
with my theory of colds.’ Opening the win-
dow, and leaping into bed, I said I had read
his letters to Dr. Cooper, in which he had ad-
vanced, that nobody ever got a cold by going
into a cold church or any other cold air, but
the theory was so little consistent with my ex-
perience, that I thought it was a paradox.
However, I had so much curiosity to hear his
reasons that I would run the risk of a cold.
The Doctor then began a harangue upon air
and cold, and respiration and_ perspiration,
with which I was so much amused that I soon
fell asleep, and left him and his philosophy to-
gether, but I believe they were equally sound
and insensible-within a few minutes after me,

“for the last words I heard were pronounced as

if he was more than half asleep. I remember
little of the lecture, except that a human body,
by respiration and perspiration, destroys a
gallon of air in a minute; that two such per-
sons as were now in that chamber, would con-
sume all the air in it in an hour or two; that
by breathing over again the matter thrown off
by the lungs and the skin, we should imbibe the
real cause of colds not from abroad, but from
within.”

PINGRY VS. RUTGERS PREP.

On the afternoon of April 26, our nine met
that of Pingry at Elizabeth. There was a
fairly large number of Prep. fellows present.
The game commenced about half-past three.
The fact that the fence on one side was very
near the diamond rendered it possible to send
the ball over it, thus making a-“‘two-bagger”
easily possible. This made the score for both
sides rather large. The game was very close
up to the very end, when the Preps. succeeded
in getting a lead, making the final score 15 for
the Preps. to 12 for Pingry. This victory was
hard fought, and all the more glorious on that
account. The team arrived here shortly after
seven o'clock. The teams and positions were

RC. PS? VS: PLAINFIELD:H. S.

The first defeat of the season was sustained
by the Preps. on Saturday, April 29, at Plain-
field. The opposing team was that of the
Plainfield High School. The Prep. nine left
New Brunswick at half-past one and arrived
at Plainfield at about a quarter of three. No
conveyance had been provided, and our team
determined not to walk the two miles to “Cres-
cent Oval,” as the field was called. After a
delay of considerably over half a@n hour a small
coach was found which would hold the nine,
and the others who had come to witness the
game were compelled to walk. The game was

called at four o'clock. The Preps. came to the
bat first. The pitcher, who was considered
very good, pitched out two men in succession,
while the third knocked the ball right into his
hands. When Plainfield came to the bat they
made four runs. This was rather discourag-
ing for the Preps. In the next inning, how-
ever, neither side scored. It was the same in
the next two innings, the score still standing
4-0. But in the fifth inning the Preps. made
five runs, while Plainfield made only one.
Score, 5-5. The game became exceedingly in-
teresting. But Plainfield went ahead again by
making five runs in the next inning. That
gave them the game, although the Preps. made
three more runs in the last two innings.

There was a large number of boys, not only
from our school but from the other schools ing
this city, who cheered for the Preps. The
cheering was very good, SRR rans” and
“zips!” being particularly po#@lar. The um-
pire acknowledged that he made a mistake in
calling one of our men out on home plate, but
said that he would have to abide by his first .
decision. One of the unfortunate things about
the game was the number of errors made by
the Prep. fellows.

The final score was, Plainfield High School,
10; Rutgers Prep., 8.

B. M.-I.iVS..R; C. P.-S:

Saturday morning, May 13, 1899, at 12.16,
the Rutgers Preparatory School team left for
Bordentown, N. J., to play a game of base-ball
against the Bordentown Military Institute.
Owing to a late dinner at the “Trap” the team
had a hot run for the train, and just caught it.
There was no wait at Trenton, as our train
made a good connection. Arriving at Bor-
dentown, we were immediately taken up to the
school, where we at once put on our suits, as
the game was scheduled for 2.30.

Promptly on time Bordentown went to the
bat, and before they left had knocked out nine
runs, most of them earned. In this inning
there were seven clean hits, which rather took
the nerve out of our team.
THE ARGO.

The game had no especial features until the
ninth inning, when our team batted out ten
runs with a slippery ball.

For our team, Kip played a good game in-
field, as he caught several difficult flies. Adams
pitched his worst game of the year, being
freely batted and having a poor control. Van
Vechten batted heavily, making a home run, a
two-bagger, and a single.

After the game the Bordentowners gave our
team a supper, in the course of which several
speeches were called for. Mr. Harrington re-
sponded, and also, in the. temporary absence
of Captain Van Vechten, Adams made a short
speech.

The teams were composed of the following

RUTGERS FRESHMEN VS. R. C. P. S.
On Monday, May 15, the Prep. nine met
that of the Rutgers Freshmen, on the diamond
of Neilson Field. There was a comparatively
large attendance, especially as no admission
fee was asked. Our team did not play with its
usual finish, and there was a large number of
errors. As the game was not called until 4.30
o'clock, only five innings were played. The
College team was as follows: R. Smith, p.;
Conger, c.; Badeau, 1 b.; Steelman (Capt.)
2 b.; Stowe, 3 b.; Devan, r. f.; Bennet, c. f.;
Randal, 1. f.; Heyer, ss. The score by innings :

THE SECOND PLAINFIELD GAME.

On Wednesday, May 24, the base-ball nine
once more met the Plainfield High School nine,
but with a far different result. The game com-
menced shortly before four o'clock at Neilson
Field. Plainfield came first to the bat. In the
first inning they scored one run, When the
Preps. came to the bat they did not get a single
run, In the second inning both sides scored
one. In the third the Preps. secured two runs,
while the P. H. S. sent no man over the home
plate. Score, Preps. 3, Plainfield 2. In the
next inning neither side scored. In the fifth
the Plainfields secured one run, making the
score a tie. In the sixth inning the Preps. ob-
tained two runs more, while in the eighth the
P. H. S. nine scored two, making the score 5
to 5. In the ninth inning neither side scored.
As the game was yet a tie, this necessitated a
tenth inning. In this inning P. H. S. scored
six runs, but with only one out the Preps.
scored seven, and then as they already had
beaten the opposing team they quit, with the
score, Preps. 12, P. H. S. 11. How much
larger a score the home team would have se-
cured it is impossible to say.

the 1.05 train to Trenton to defeat the nine of
the New Jersey State School. The game was

full of interest, close and exciting. Both of
the teams put up a very good game. The at-
tendance was rather large, several of the Prep.
boys accompanying the nine. The team came
home in high spirits. Those who accompanied
the nine to Trenton were well repaid by wit-
nessing a very interesting game.

ANNEX EXERCISES.

The annual exercises of the “Annex,” which
were held on Thursday morning, May 25, were
as successful as usual. The porch in the rear
of the building was very tastefully decked with
leaves and flowers, and in the centre stood a
beautiful May Pole. The lawn in front of the
porch was filled with benches, upon which the
friends and relatives of the children sat. At
10.15 Miss Hurlburt made a short address and
told what the pupils were about to do. The
first part consisted of choruses and a recitation
by John Visel. The second part was the
“Crowning of the May Queen.” The queen
was Miss Edna Barbour. This was a very
pretty ceremony, and the dance about the May
Pole elicited great applause. After the exer-
cises were at an end, Miss Hurlburt invited
all the spectators to come in and see specimens
of the childrens’ handiwork.

THEATER CLUB SEES "JUNO AND THE
PaYCOCK"
Boys Open Season with Sean
O'Casey's Tragedy
Performance of Irish Players En-
joyed By All
The Rutgers Prep Theater Club
opened its season last Friday
night by journeying to New York
to see the Abbey Theater Players
from Dublin, Ireland present
"Juno and the Paycock", a power-
ful tragedy by Sean O'Casey. The
play, looked upon by critics as
the best the Abbey Players have
yet produced, is most unusual,
its tragedy being made more
poignant by the high comedy of
its beginning. The story deals
with the downfall of the for-
tunes of "Captain" Boyle, por-
trayed by P.J.Carolan, his wife,
"Juno" Boyle, played by Eileen
Crowe, and their children, John-
ny and Mary, portrayed by Arthur
Shields and Aileen O'Connor, The
boys especially enjoyed the
strong portrayal of the drunken,
worthless "Captain" and his pa-
tient, suffering wife. The next
play which the Club hopes to see
is "The Star-Wagon", by Maxwell
Anderson, starring Burgess Mere-
dith and Lillian Gish.

SWIMMERS SHOW GENERAL
ALL ROUND IMPROVEMENT

Practice, last week, brought
out more of the rights and
wrongs of swimming. Some boys
are striving to become good dis-
tance men, while others, doing
continuous sprints, are practi-
cing for the shorter distances.
If this is any foreshadowing,
we can take for granted the
results of the coming season.
Time trials brought out the fol-
lowing results:

THE "ARGO"

Years ago when a school paper was
introduced to Rutgers Prep it was
"an adventure", as it is today.
In those days Groek was a subject
of the school and those who were
studying it had just finished
reading about the adventures of
Jason and his quest of the Golden
Fleece. Henec, what better name

coulda be used than the name of
his boat, the "Argo".

Dear Ed,

It has been eroneously ru-
mored about school recently, that
Joel (Pop) Fertig was the fortu-
nate recipient of ten new smacka-
roos won in the Local Order of
Elks lottery, As I understand it
is ever the endoavor of the Argo
to put before its readers the
truth. I take pleasure in an-
nouncing that Pop has denounced
the rumor as a tangled skein of
fabricatca ovidence (lies to
youse). I take still greator
pleasure in announcing to Mr.
Shepard that the honor of the
School is still clean and no fil-
thy lucre has found its way to
our pockets from any unlawful
entorprisc.

Yours for more Chips,

An Argoite.

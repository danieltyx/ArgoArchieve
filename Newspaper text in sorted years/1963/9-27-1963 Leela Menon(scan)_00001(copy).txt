by Doris Adler

The Cheerleaders of Rutgers
Prep School have chosen a new
member to round out the squad.
On Tuesday, September 24, the
Junior Varsity Cheerleaders of
the 1962-63 squad competed to
fill in the one vacant Varsity
space. Amy Levy was selected
by Mr. Richard O*Connell, ath-
letic director , judged the com-
petition. The Varsity Cheerlead-
ers now include Captain Lynne
Spiro, Doria Adler, Ruth Cassell,
Vivian Czarda, Althea Davis,
Edith Freedman, Amy Levy and
Barbora Tomkinson

The Cheerleaders have worked!
very hard practicing old cheers

 

and developing new ones, and
they will once again do their
great job of providing inspir-

ation to the players, of making
a lot of noise, and giving the
spectators sowething nice to
look at.

 

Big Ben FPickar says:
“Let's beat Jamesburg." The
only way you'll find out wheth-
er we win or not is to come to
the game, at Prep's fields at
three o'clock today.”

Neivert then told the group of the forth coming hayride

which will be held on Friday,
October 18. The Dance Committee
will also see to the details
and planning of subsequent dan
ceSo

Approximately fifty people
attended the combined meeting
and practically all of them ex=-
pressed a desire to join two or
more of the committees. In speak-
ing to committee members, Pres-
ident Jacobs said that, " The
sucess or failure of these comm-
ittee venture: is entirely de-
pendent on the attitude of the
students participating on the
committees. If some ability is
mingled with some enthusiasm,
then we can serve others as well]
as have fun ourselves."

JAIESBURG HIGH
WINS SOCCERAMA

by Bill Landau

Janesburg High school was
declared the winner of the first
Twin county Soccer League Soc-
cerama, which was held on Sate
urdey » September 21 at Rutgers
Prep’s soccor fields. Rutgers
Prep was third in the stand=-
ings with four points, trail=
ing East Brunswick, who had
six, and Jamesburg, who had
seven, l’ourth place went to
Edison liigh School and fifth
place to Woodbridge. Each of
these teams, Jamesburg, Edison,
East irunswick, Woodbridge and
Prep, was to play one fifteen
minute quarter against each
of the other members with the
winner receiving two points.
ror a tle, only one point
would be received. At the end
of four quarters, the team
with the most points was to be
declared the winner and receive
a trophy.

All five teams showed a
good potential in thelr plrying
ability. The Prep team, one of
the highor ranting members of
the lee.ue, ended the day with
& roacord of one win, two ties
and one loss, The win came in
the first game ogainst Woodbridge
in which Bill Landau scored the
winning goal. The next two
genee against East Brunswick
and Edison respectively, ended
in a tie. Prep hada good
score up to this point with a
good chance of taking home the
trophy if 4% could beat James=-
burg in the next game. Prep
lost that game by one to noth-
ing on a goal scored in the
final five minutes.

Even though Prep lost that
last game, a lot of credit mat
be given to ite players for
thelr defensive play. There
tas only one goal scored against
the team all doy. This defen-
give cane was led by one of the
more experienced players, the
soalle, ifike Jacobs, who played
an outetanding game, Ed Imber
also played « fine came. Prep
did not win the soccerana, but
the regular season haa not yet
begun and I am sure that with

 

the tean being able to rely on
its Jefensive game, the offense
will be able to be inproved,

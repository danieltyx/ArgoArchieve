Yearbook Staff Attends
nce At New York

Stover, Karshmer, Lipman, licssina,

On October 14 and 15 several staff
members of Ye Dial attended the an-
nual yearbook conference offered by the
Columbia Scholastic Press Association
at Columbia University. Among those
who went on the trip were Clemmie
Vitti, Editor in Chief, Barbara Lipman,
Copy Editor, Joe Messina, Photography
Editor, Bernard Karshmer, Business
Manager, Carl Stover. Art Editor and
Mr. Gaggini, Faculty Adviser.

Upon arriving in New York, the
group checked in at their hotel and
later went on to Columbia where they
attended various lectures on the rules
and regulations for producing a good
yearbook. At these meetings general
tips on layout, financing, and general
work were offered by men with exper-
lence in the field.

The staff's next stop was at the
library where the yearbooks, entered
by various schools, were on exhibit.
They found that the press association
had given last year's Ye Dial a second
place rating among books entered un-
der the category of co-ed private
schools,

Early Saturday morning two more
clinics were held and the _ executive
board split in order to attend all the
meetings. After thal they were guests
at a luncheon offered by the C.S.P.A,

Prep Undergoes

Its Evaluations

by HOWARD TOBIN

On October 17 and 18 Rutgers Prep
underwent an evaluation survey by an
eleven man committee representing the
Middle States Association of College
and Secondary Schools. The purpose
of this evaluation is to aid the school
in maintaining the highest educational
practices possible.

The decisions reached by this com-
mittee were almost completely compli-
mentary and mentioned no serious de-
fects. Special praise was given to the
students concerning the dress and
personal appearance. The evaluation
committee in their oral report to the
faculty, expressed great approval con-
cerning the interest of the students in
the school.

Committee states views on activities

Several points of constructive crit-
icism were offered in the oral report
but were prefaced by the committee’s
understanding that it would be imposs-
ible to incorporate all these suggestions
into a school of our type. The great
value of a music and art appreciation
course was stated, and the committee
expressed their desire to see a physical
education program for all boys and
girls in the school.

The athletic facilities at Prep were
found to be adequate, but the scattered
location of the gym and athletic fields
were considered a drawback.

Committee compliments student body

Besides complimenting the school’s
educational facilities, the evaluators
reported their observation of the neat-
ness of the school, and the considera-
tion of the students in maintaining

this neatness.

Since the last evaluation, two func-
tions have been added to the school
which met with the hearty approval
of the Middle States Association staff.
These were the introduction of a li-

brary in the school itself and the
inauguration of a guidance program.
The association feels that these are

two very important aspects of a sec-
ondary school,

opportunity to thank the entire staff
for all the cooperation they have given

Dear Editor:

Although it has not been usual for
teachers to write letters in this column,
I hope you will allow me to use your
column for a suggestion to the stu-
dents. This year, I think that the
school paper could be developed more
fully as a genuine and constant ex-
pression of student opinion. The Letters

place for this development. I would
enjoy seeing, in every issue, sincere and
spontaneous comments from the stu-
dents on all phases of our school life.
In this issue, for example, two students
have been able to express personal
epinions to the entire school through

the convenient medium provided by the

SPOR TLIGHT

By JOE MESSINA

The spotlight for this issue shines on
the current sport, soccer. The Prep
team, this year, has plenty of potential.
It has talent and definite will to win,
both of which should give us a winning
chance this season.

Our goalie, this year, is George
Friedlander, a Plainfield import, who
has proved both sensible and spirited.
When the chips are down, we can
always count on George to come
through. Bob Torrone and Bill Utter
are our two fighten’ fullbacks. Bobby,
a letter winner at Jamesburg last year,
has added that extra punch in the
defense He is assisted by Mushkie who
earned the tricks of fullback

Deadlock Jamesburg Eleven

On October 5, Rutgers Prep fought
Jamesburg at home to a 0-0 deadlock.
Jt was a nip and tuck battle all the way
down to the last second of the game.

Although Jamesburg tried time and
time again to get the ball past the
goalie, George Friedlander, he and our
fullbacks played an excellent game.

Jamesburg had control of the bali
in the first period, but both teams
fought with equal aggressiveness in the
second. In the third period Prep came
back with a burst of spirit only to
lose it in the last quarter.

It was

Junior Varsity Bows
To Jamesburg Team

The Rutgers J.V. fought a losing
battle against Jamesburg Thursday,
Oct. 13th, taking a 5-0 beating. Rutgers

kicked off first, but the Jamesburg
eleven took possession and drew blood
early in the first quarter with a hard-
kicked shot by their right wing. After
this, Billy Smith, the J.V. goalie,
settled down, saving many good shots
from becoming goals. However, in the
last minutes of the first quarter, one
more tally hit the corner of the goal,
making the score 2-0.

Joe Messina replaced Smith at goalie
in the second quarter and, before that
period was over, another score zipped
through.

Prep kept the ball upfield fairly well
through the efforts of Eazl Nielsen
Dick Twitchell, and center-halfback
Bruce Gunkel. In spite of shots by
Danny Struk and Bob Smith, Prep
was unable to score.

The J.V. team seems to be producing
some varsity material, Although they
were trounced, they did not make a
bad showing. Many of the members
Jack experience. Fullbacks Messina,
Bushell, and Harrison, compose a fairly
strong defense, but the team needs
more offensive aggressiveness.

Prep Coach Teaches Gym
To Lower School Pupils

Mr. O'Connell, our coach and biology
teacher, has added a new job to his
schedule. Everyday Coach O'Connell
goes down to the Elementary school
to teach gym to the boys.

The older boys play the various
sports as they come into season. How-
ever, in the beginning of the year,
Coach O’Connell didn’t have the boys
playing soccer or football. Instead, the
boys were taught the fundamentals
of all the sports. Mr. O'Connell has
reported having some lively basketball
games lately. The older boys will prob-
ably play basketball until spring, when
baseball will start.

Mr. O’Connell has a different pro-
grom for the younger boys. Instead of
playing the various sports as they come
into season, the boys are taught how
to run and jump correctly. Also, Mr.
O'Connell teaches the younger boys
the fundamentals of all sports. Thus,
the Elementary School boys will know
how to play the sports when they be-
come eligible.

CHEERLEADING

By GAIL DUSCHOCK

This year, efforts are being made to
develope our cheerleading activities
into a more essential function of the
school. In the past years, the cheer-
leading squads were not as well-or-
ganized because enthusiasm was lack-
ing.

The foundation for an ever-improving
squad is being achieved this year. Many
ideas are being tried. Not only in
soccer, but in all sports, the school
is developing more Junior Varsity ac-
tivities. For this reason, a Junior Var-
sity and a Varsity group have been
fully outfitted and trained to encourage
the boys on to victory. Also, many
new rules formed by Mr. Heinlein.
headmaster, Mrs. Wilson, faculty ad-
visor, and the co-captains are helping
to raise the standards ot this group.

Inquiring Reporter

By Jacqueline Fiermonti
and Mernan Hartley
What do you think of the present
guidance program, and can you suggest
any improvements?

Danny Struk — “I think it’s a very
nice thing to have, and every school
should have it, but I think that the
pupils should pick their own teachers
instead of being assigned to them.”

Judy Anekstein — “I think it’s very
good and it is essential in order thai
all the students’ problems be handlec
by proper authority. So far no im-
provements are needed.”

Wendell Wilson — “It’s a lot bette
than last year, but it can be improvec
by having groups more uniform.”

Bob F. Smith — “I feel it offers gooc

“| opportunities for progress in all sub

solfe Harrison — “The guidancc

ram is an excellent idea; however
successful, I feel meetings shoulc
more often, and_ student:
sid co-operate more than they did
year.”

Joy Newman — “I think it is very
good, but we really haven’t had time
to try it out.”

Jim Ness — “I think that it is avery
good, idea and a better one could not
be devised. I think it is as good at it
could be.”

Merle Schiffmayer — “I think it is
a good thing. It helps new students,
like myself, to feel more at home.”

Howard Tobin — “I think that the
present guidance program is a good
idea, for it gives those who need gui-
dance the opportunity to get it.”

Mike Schemick — “I don’t think that
we've had time to try it out. I think
we should be able to choose our own
advisers.”

Barbara Lipman — “ If it’s like last
year, it's horrible. The students should
have more attention.”

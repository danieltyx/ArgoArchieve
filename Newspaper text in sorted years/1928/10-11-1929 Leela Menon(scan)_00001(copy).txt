Learning to play Is part of any
man’s liberal education, Mr.!
Kelly. Many an older man, he as-

 

serted, regrets in later life that he
never learned to play when a boy,
since play in connection with mod-
ern business becomes a necessity.
so pointed out the necessity of
ting the social uniformities, at
least to a large extent, and that not}
fford to be en-

 

 

 

even a genius can
tirely unlike his fellows. Play is the
great opportunity for learning

 

be like other people and for learn-
ing to understand other people.
‘Try out a few new things now and |
then, he suggested. Try yourself
out. Merely because you can not
swim or dance at the present time
is no reason for persisting in those
deficiencies, he advised.
Manion and Brown Speak
Mr. Manion followed with
cteristically rousing speech in
which he told of the religious lift
that he had experienced by attend-

He recommended to all the tone of

plans for the season, derived from
his study of the athletic needs of

|die Hayes the season's first Stu-
dents’ Association meeting of Rut-
gers Prep was held Friday after-
noon, October 4. Speeches were
jmade by Hayes, Tiernan, Cam-
pagna and Rosen, and cheers were
led by Martin and McDonough.

acuity members also participated,
Mr. Kell; Mr. Brown, and Coach
Hennig giving stirring speeches,

| Mr. Kelly made the most telling
|speech of the meeting, recalling
previous football seasons and the
|well-known Rutgers Prep spirit,
|which carries on in spite of rain,
j)mud, and other handicaps. Mr.
Brown related instances when stu-
dent support had been almost 100
|per cent even when a considerable
| burden of expense was placed upon
the rooters’ section. Coach Hennig
spoke of the uncertainity of the
strength of Pennington, and sald
\that he was confident that Prep's
Jteam would not lack fight as It

rhool Wit Aids
Tiernan in his speech made ef-
fective use of his well-known wit
and sarcasm in urging support for
the team, and Campagna made a
strong appeal for the hearty sup-
port of all because this Is his last
year here and he wishes to leave
with a winning team as one of his
memories, Rosen also spoke to good
effect, The meeting concluded with
cheers and songs.

MR. MANIO

Mr, Manton, our new Latin teach-
er, has a personality which is some-
what of a drawback to him. He has
» large a following hanging upon
his every word that he can scarcely
move. He has a sense of humor
equal to that of two ordinary men,
most unusual in a teacher of the
jeclassical languages.

Mr. Manion is a graduate of
Trinity, having been in the class
of 1923. He graduated from Union
Theological Seminary of New York
in 1928 with the degree of Bachelor
of Divinity, He has done a great
deal of tutoring ever since his first
year in high school in Latin, Greek,
French and English, and has taken
sraduate work at Harvard. Mr.
Manion hus also done « great deal
jof socktl service werk.

wus a severe blow to Prep, us the

that he will soon be back in form.

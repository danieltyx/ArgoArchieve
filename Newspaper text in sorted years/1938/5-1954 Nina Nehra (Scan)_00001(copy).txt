Student Council
Schedules Prom
For Early June

Prep will, this year, as in past years,
hold its spring Senior Prom. This year,
however, the Student (Council decided to
hold it later than usual. The reason
for the late date of the dance was that
other school functions intervened at all
other possible times.

The date has been set for June 5th, a
Saturday night. After a great deal of
discussion by the dance committee mem-
bers, it has been decided that the prom
will again be held at the Rutgers Prep
gymnasium.

The dance will be handled, as usual, by
president of the junior class, who is
automatically elected chairman of the
dance each year. This year’s prom will
be directed by Clifford Griggs who hopes
for a good turnout.

The pre-dance preparations will be
made, for the most part, by the junior
class. It has always been the custom
at Prep for the juniors to give a dance
for the departing seniors. Most of the
important details will be handled by Dave
Hendler, Stu Edelberg, and Clementina
Vitti, who is in the sophomore class.

Cliff Griggs has hired a band for the
prom which is hoped to be a good one.
The name of the band suggests that it
is out of this world. It is called the
“Constellation” and its leader is Charlie
Smith.

54-55 Argo Staff Publishes
Last Edition of School Year

A new system of election and nomina-
tion of the Argo editor and reporters
was carried out this year. It is a brand
new idea which seems to be accepted
and well liked by all concerned,

The slate for class editors was drawn
up by the present staff. It consisted of
persons who had done work on
the paper. In most cases the nominees
were present class editors and a reporter
from each class. Former editors if not
re-elected immediately became reporters,
The remaining reporter for each class
was nominated and elected at a meeting
of the entire staff.-In this manner, it is
fhoped that all deserving and well quali-
fied people will have an equal chance
to be on the Argo staff.

The new staff is deeply grateful to the
1953-54 staff for giving next year’s staff
this chance to put out the last Argo of
this schoo! year. If successfui, this meth-
od will be repeated in years to come,
thus making the Argo better than ever
before.

Plan Many Awards
For June Graduates

As the school year comes to an end,
there is in the minds of many the thouyht
of graduation. This year’s graduation
will be on Thursday, June 10th. When
the students assemble in the study hall
at 8:30, there will be many ‘happy faces
and some sad ones.

After everyone is present, the stu-
dents will all walk to church where the
awards and prizes will be given. The
first award is given to the person who
has achieved the highest honors in
scholarship. The next award is the Joyce
Kilmer English (prize, and for the history
enthusiast, the Alexander Johnston His-
tory prize is awarded. The Dorr Prize
in science is given to the person who
has excelled in science for the past year,
and for the math students, the Class of
1876 Prize in Mathematics. is awarded.
There are two awards given for foreign
languages, the Latin prize and_ the
Romance Language prize. The Time Cur-
rent Affairs Prizes are given to the stu-
dents who received the highest mark on
the Current Affairs Test. The Ye Dial
award is given to the two persons who
have done the most to ipublish the
Ye Dial. Other prizes given are: the
Rensselaer Medal, the Liberty Loan
Prize, and the Cum Laude, for which
five students are chosen.

After the awards are given and all the
speeches are made, the graduating class
may go. As they leave, the seniors are
thinking of that first day in college and
the underclassmen of another year at

Prep.

Combine For Successful Play

For the first time, the Rutgers Pre-
paratory School produced a full three
act play in place of their annual spring
concert. The play was the comedy, “The
Man Who Came To Dinner,” by Moss
Hart and George Kauffman. It starred
Mike Kessler, as Mr. Whiteside, the
man who came to dinner.

The play was presented in the gym-
nasium which, under the expert super-
vision of Mr. Mcffat and his stage crew
was transformed into the living room
of Mr. and Mrs. Stanley (the setting of
the play). The stage and lighting crew
was composed of Stan Bey, Kathe Van
Vechten, Stu Edelberg, Cliff Griggs, Al
Murasko, Tono Rebollo, Lowell Wagner
and John Perduk.

It. took many weeks to perfect the
play. The talent and experience was,
at first, lacking, but under the direction
of Mr. Dumarae and Mrs. Wilson, all
roughness was smoothed out, and
glimpses of talent began to make their
way out of experience. The make-up
and props were supplied by the students
themselves.

The play, although it called for a
large cast, was really a one-man play.
The large task of memorizing and act-
ing out the part of Sheridan Whiteside
was very capably handled by Mike Kess-
ler. Howard Tobin played the part of
the incomparable Banjo. His actions
brought down the house. The female
parts were headed by Elfriede Ridder-
ing, who played the Maggie Cutler part,
and Shirley Kerber, who portrayed Lor-
raine Sheldon. The bewildered Doc
Bradley was Carl Stover and his frus-
trated nurse was Sharon Ries. Estelle
Newman and Don Hughes were well cast
as Mr. and Mrs. Stanley who had the
misfortune of having Whiteside’s com-
pany.

Announce Raised Standards

For All Academic Program

It ‘has been announced by Mr. Hein-
lein and explained by Mr. Holley that
there will be a definite elevation of
standards at Prep next year. It can be al-
ready recognized ‘by a great many stu-
dents that the work is slowly getting
harder.

It is altogether necessary, however,
that the students realize that the work
is being made harder to help them in
their studies at Prep.

We're Off and Running!

Yes, we’re off and running on what
we hope is the right foot. The last edi-
tion, as you can see, has the same gen-

How-

eral form as the previous issues.

ever, a few modifications have been

made which we hope will add more

eolor and create more interest in what
is known as a small school paper.

Of course, our first issue will have a
few loop-holes, but we know that with
the invaluable experience gained from
producing this issue we will be able to
iron out all future troubles in the fol-
lowing issues.

However, I, as editor, have little to
do with the making of the paper or the
opinions contained here-in. I only as-
signed the subjects and allowed the
staff a free hand in all written articles.
My job was only to see that the job
came off. smoothly.- .

Next year there will be a change in
the paper-which will be quite noticeable
to all. I cannot divulge its nature to
the student body at the present time,
but it will be revealed in the first issue
of the next school year.

I would like to thank the entire staff
for their cooperation in producing this
issue. I would also like to extend my
thanks to the out-going staff for their
help in producing this issue. My only
hope is that I may do as good a job dur-
ing my editorship.

By JOHN ROSA

What do you think of the Honor
System? Do you think it would be
successful in our school?

JOHN PERDUK—

“I think the honor system is a good
system, but I do not think an honor sys-
tem would ‘be successful if started in
Rutgers Prep, unless it was started at the
elementary school first.”

JOHN MARGOLIS—
“I think the idea is a good one, and
it should work out pretty well at Prep.

DICK SCHWARTZ—
“Yes, I think the honor system would

be successful. It would teach the students
responsibility.”

DIANE DORN—

“I think that the honor system is a
good way by which to conduct the school.
As for our school, the only way to learn

whether or not it will be successful is
to try it out.”

JOE HOROWITZ—

“In my opinion, the honor system in
our school would be an excellent idea.
I think it would produce more honest
and trustworthy students.”

CARL STOVER—

“I think it is a very good idea, Wheth-
er or not it would work would be best
determined by trying it out.” ~

WESTON MERRITT—

“It is good in many ways, because it
puts a student on his own. But, I think,
some kids would fool around too much
to put such a system into effect here.”

MARIAN VEALE—

“The honor system is an excellent meth-
od for teaching students to become ma-
ture in their thinking. The honor system
im Prep; I: think, would tbe very success-
ful. It would give the students a chance
to prove that they can be trusted.”

ROLFE HARRISON—
“I am neutral!”

Letters to the Editor

Dear Editor:

Standard exams are definitely a bad
practice, because they do not apply to
most schools, I say this because an exam
made up by the teacher himself will ve
much more searching and would find out
more precisely what the student has
learned during the year. In the first place,
the teacher knows exactly what the stu-
dents should have learned and, in the
second place, he can test the student
more effectively than a person who does
not even know the student and his in-
telligence quota for that particular sub-
ject. In the view of these facts, I believe
that the standard tests could be taken
with ease by some students and with
great difficulty by others. in the long
run, the students will show what they
have learned more effectively if the
exams are made by the teacher.

 

—ndescribably delicious ‘

Thank you,
PETE SCHWARTZ.

Honor Roll Cited

At the close of the fifth marking period,
sixceen students made the honor roll,
At the tog of the list was Diane Dorn,
followed closely ‘by Barbara Lipman,
Roger Seamon, Franklin Preiser, Car}
s:over, Louise Di Lalo, Joseph Messina
and Stuart Edelberg, all of whose ‘marks
were 90 or above.

Additional qualifiers for the honor rol)
were Eugene tHohol, Tono Rebollo, Kathe
Van Vechten, Richard Schwartz, Clifford
Griggs, Clementina Vitti, Joseph Becker
ana Stanley Bey.

The following eight students received
honorable mention for certifying in all
their subjects except one. This group
was headed by Howard Tobin, followed
by Jonathan Margolis, Malcolm Cohen,
Patricia Rose, Marian Veale, John Flan-
agan, Patricia Lancaster and Jack Geil-
ing.

ven Mr. Heinlein read the names on
the honcr roll, he congratulated the qual-
ifiers but made it clear that he was not
at all pleased with the small number of
students on the list. The headmaster also
urged the student body to work harder
in the final marking period, .

Limelight

This month’s “Limelight” falls on a
very likeable senior, Weston Merritt. Al-
though this is his first year at Prep, it
did not take him long to become une
of the best known students in the school.
His varied and comical antics have
brought a touch of humor to the school
and helped make the year more enjuy-
able.

Wes’ main interests, as far as athletics
go, are tennis and track. Throughout
the vear he keeps in excellent condition
‘by running around the block and be mak-
ing his famous sprints to the grocery
store thirty seconds before the bell.- In ~
reference to his track ability, the “Mer-
ritt Mile” will alwavs be remembered—
three minutes, with three stops for cig-
arettes. se

Weston is always looking for a good
ouy in cars. Besides owning a 1950 two-
door Ford, the latest rumor is that ne
is planning to buy three 1938 Fords at
$25 each. .

Although he is not one of the top stu-
dents, he is always making a great ef-
fcrt, and this “never die” policy is sure
to lead him to success. He previously at-
tended Trenton High School and is plan-
ning to attend the University of Tennes-
see and study for the ministry.

 

The Clock Ticks On

Listen my children and you shall hear

That examinations are very near.

All your hearts should fill with fear

As you sit there shedding many a tear.

7 you frown and fret and weep and
wail,

You should be working or you will fail.

For if you're thinking of a college career,

Your hopes will be dashed unless you

re-steer.

SPORTLIGHT

By Clifford Griggs

Basketball has gone out of the picture
and now baseball has become the dom-
inant sport at Prep. This edition of
~pportlight” will for the most part
describe the players who have proved
to be the greatest assets so far this year.

Al Murasko, after finishing a sizzling
season in basketball, is doing a great
job in hurling the “horsehide” for Prep.
Although his record shows no wins as
or yet, still 1c is no indication of a lack
of ability on his part. The Little Scar-
let’s team this year is composed for the
greater part of inexperienced players
and therefore cannot be downed for its
lack of sharpness.

As of yet, Prep’s only victory has
been over Jamesburg. Behind the strong
arm of Bill Kurtz, the teamsters pushed
on to a stirring victory completely de-
feating a very good opponent, 9-5. Bill
continued ‘his arousing display of pitch-
ing ability until very late in the game.
Noi until the seventh inning did he get in-
to any difficulty and then the old reliable
Al Murasko came in. Al pitched peerless
ball, allowing only one of the three men
jeft on base by Kurtz to score.

Murasko has surely been a most im-
portant figure in all sports activities
this year. After a very good season as
goalie on the soccer team he rose to
stardom on Prep’s basketball team. He
was this year elected to first team
All State for Prep schools. Al Murasko
will not be forgotten for a long time
for his total of 563 points in basketball.

The only possibility of failure will be
credited this year in part to the Prep
track team. As hard as Coach Moffat
tried to get fellows to come out on the
track and work, there was little or no
results at all shown in that field of

ainletics. You let him down, fellows!

Lettermen to Spark Soccer
By Stan Rosenblum

Rutgers Prep’s soccer team, which had
the best season in the school’s ‘history,
is looking for another promising season.

Stu Edelberg, who will be a senior
next year, is expected to play a big part
in the prepster’s hopes. This year, while
a junior, Stu set a school record by
kicking eight goals in one season. We
would also like to congratulate S.u on
receiving honorable mention on the All-
State Soccer Team, Other members who
should hely the team are Dave Hendler,
a speedy wing with a good foot; Buddy
Zajac, a half-back with good soccer sense,
and Joe Messina, a center-forward who
should put fear into many a goalie with
hard kicking from either foot. With
four letter men back, I will predict that
the Prepsters will have a .500 season or

better.

Sayreville Defeats Prep
With Fifth Inning Rally

Sports Flash — On the 11th of May,
Prep lost a very important game to a
very strong Peddie team. The final
score rested at 82 and made Prep’s
record for the year one win and nine
losses.

Buddy Zajac went the entire dis-
tance for the Prepsters hurling the horse-
hide at Peddie and yielding ten hits.
Buddy was converted from lhis usual spot
at second base and placed on the hill by
Coach O’Connell.

One of the highlights of the game was
a terrific onehanded catch in deep right
field by Al Marcy, for which he was
applauded by both teams. Bad things
usually follow good ones and in this
case there was no exception. In the very
next inning, Gene Zick was hurt when
ihe tried to field a high fly to left field
and collided with shortstop Kurtz.

Although Prep has still only one win,
nevertheless, we are quite sure that the
team will start to click.

College For Athletes

By Roger Seamon

This year’s basketball team, as you
know, was a big success and all the
players were stars in their own right.
Although Al Murasko was the big scorer,
it was the team work that reaily won for
Prep.

Al Murasko, our star forward, had
many offers from many colleges. Of all
these, however, the lucky one whom he
chose was Hofstra, a college of good
standing in Long Island. He expects to
follow physical training and should do
very well.

There is also Len Bartlett wno expects
to go to Duke, Being an exceptionally
good basketball player, Len will prob-
ably be outstanding there.

Don Etghes, our giant center, will go
to Villanova or Georgetown and, of
course, will be a good center there. He
was second in scoring to Al Murasko

 

and also should do quite wel.

Our great back court man, Willie
Kurtz, will go to Lafayette. Judging
from his great playing and fine play
making this year, he should easily break
into a starting line up. As you all know,
his deadly set shots and tricky driving
made him a terrific threat and terror to
the enemy’s defenses.

Rutgers Prep lost to Sayreville High
School to end their series with the Bomb-
ers. The Little Scarlet lost both games
by the identical scores of 5-3, but pro-
vided stiff competition all the way. This
defeat thas dropped the Prepsters to one
win and eight defeats.

The Bombers drew first blood scoring
two in the first inning and one in the
third. They got but two hits off the
fine pitching of Willie Kurtz, taking ad-
vantages of many miscues by Prep.

The fourth was the big one for the
Little Scarlet as they scored all of their
three runs. Dave Buchine walked to
start things off and went to second on
Gene Zick’s single. Buddy Zajac then
walked to fill the bases. At this point
Fritz, the Sayreville pitcher, seemed ter-
rifically wild, as he walked the third
man of the inning, Carl Baratta, forcing
Buchine to score.

Another pitcher replaced Fritz and got
Murasko to ground out to first. The
pitcher covering tagged him and tripped
over the base. By the time the ball was
recovered both Zick and Zajac had
scored. However, Baratta, trying for
third on the play was tagged out to end
the inning.

In the fifth inning some more Prep
errors were made, and the winning run
scored on in-field miscue followed by a
triple scoring Sayreville’s winning run.
ae insurance run came home on a pass
The rest of the game was quiet as
Prep’s hitting went numb, and Al Mur-
asko’s fine pitching set the Bombers
down hitless.

To Head ‘Dial’ Staff!

On Wednesday, May 12th, the 1954 Ye

Dial was distributed. Students and
faculty alike were loud in their praise
of the improvements over previous year-
books.

Already work has begun on the 1955

Ye Dial, with the selection of the Co- |‘

editors-in-chief, Stanley Bey and Roger
Seamon. This is a change from former
years but it is hoped that it will lessen
the load on the editors and produce a
better yearbook. Along with Mr. Gag-
gini, who is in his fourth successful year
as advisor to Ye Dial, they have chosen
the editorial staff for the 1955 Ye Dial.

Returning to her position as editor,
where she did a wonderful job on the ’54
annual, is Diane Dorn, Malcolm Cohen,
who served as junior editor this pasi
year, will fill the photography editorship.
Between his sports and editorship of the
Argo, Stu Edelberg will work on the Ye
Dial as Sports Editor.

Clementina Vitti, who has had much
experience on previous staffs, will be
copy editor for the Ye Dial.

The Argo staff wishes to extend its
congratulations to the new Ye _ Dial
officers and hopes that this coming year
will be as successful as the past year.

Edelberg and Griggs Name
New Party for Fall Election

As the school year is already coming
to a close, one of the most important
topics coming up is the formation of
next year’s Student Council. A group of
students have already drawn up a party.
The candidates up for election un tvis
ticket are Stuart Edelberg, president,
Clifford Griggs, vice-president, Clemen-
tina Vitti, secretary, and Joe Messina,
treasurer. In setting up the party, the
group has complied with the strict qual-
ifications of the school constitution. As
the latter states, the two chief offices
should be held ‘by representatives from
the senior class. The constitution further
states that the office of secretary and
treasurer should be filled by a junior
and sophomore, respectively. As yet, the
party has not decided on a definite name.
However, that will be done next year.

Kuhithau, Dorn Attend Dinner

Many Changes Stud

New Look Yearbook

The 1954 Ye Dial made its first ap-
pearance on May 12th, when it was dis-
tributed to the students during the ac-
tivities pericd. The most noticeable dif-
ference between this and previous year
pooks was the padded cover which add-
ed greatly to its attractiveness. Also,
the book was published by the photo-
offset method this year, which allowed
for much more freedom in layout and
the inclusion of many pictures. This
meant that Ye Dial was much less for-
mal than previous yearbooks, and
of course, the pictures added greatly to
its interest and appearance. The new
method of publication also permitted
the bock to come out earlier than usual,
and the staff believes that this early
publication is an excellent idea, al-
though it means the ommission of spring
sports.

The editors and staff are to be com-
mended for the fine job which they did
in producing Ye Dial’ Also a word of
thanks should go to the faculty advisor,
Mr. Gaggini, who said that he was tre-
mendously pleased with the book, but
that there is still some room for im-
provement.

Pinafore, Skits Star
In Spring Production

This year the Elementary school is
holding more and better spring produc-
tions than ever,

On May 3rd the first grade programs
were held, This was a colorful affair at
which May baskets were given to all the
mothers. The second and third grade
plays were given on Tuesday of the
same week.

The fourth and fifth grades program
was held May 10th. This consisted of a
play entitled “The Sleeping Beauty,”
several pantomimes and two skits. The
names of these skits were not revealed
to the audience until after them, at
which time the audience themselves
were asked to give the names. The skits
were excerpts from Huckleberry Fin
and Penrod. This was also done after
the pantomimes which were incidents
in the lives of Ponce de Leon, Benjamin
Franklin, George Washington and
Thomas Edison.

On_ an undecided date late in May
the sixth and seventh grade chorus will
present the operetta H. M. S. Pinafore.
This performance will be given under
the direction of the school’s music in-
structor, Mrs. Margaret Kelly.

During the spring vacation the fourth
grades displayed their handicraft by
making models of such scenes as Roose-
velt Dam, the Congo, a skier in the
Swiss Alps, a covered wagon scene and
desert scenes. These models were to
illustrate the school work they have
been doing and were put on exhibit at
their spring program. .

 

Introduce Placement Exams
To Aid in College Planning

It has just been announced by Mr.
Heinlein that there will be certain tests
given next year. These tests, however,
will not be given to all students at Prep.
The exams will be given to seniors only
and will prove to be a great asset to
Prepsiters,

The tests will be given as an aid to
students so that it is possible for them
to find out what they are (best suited for.
The exams, however, cannot be taken
with a cesual attitude by anyone if they
are going to be successful. The seniors
will have to cooperate to their fullest
extent.

The tests will give all seniors a defi-
nite idea of their capabilities. They will
also help them in making their choice
of a college.

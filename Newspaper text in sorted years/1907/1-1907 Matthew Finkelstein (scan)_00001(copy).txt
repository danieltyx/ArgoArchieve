THE LOST RIVER CAVE

oa

 

Nestled in the foothills of the Green Moun-
‘tains in Vermont, lies the village of Bolton;
a little way south of the town the Winooski
River winds its seapliaeay toward Lake
Champlain. Bolton is ndt a ‘large town, but
some years ago it was large enough to attract
the attention of a gang of thieves. That this
gang was well organized was beyond doubt;
twice they had broken in—first, into the hard-
ware store, where they literally cleaned out
the stock of firearms and augurs and files;
next they tried the dry goods store, and suc-
ceeded in getting away with many rolls of
silks and flannels. Now to top the climax, the
post-office had been robbed, the safe had been
blown open, and the stamps and money taken
amounted to a considerable sum. And still no
trace of the burglars could be found. Gov-
ernment detectives had been baffled, the vil-
lagers lived in constant fear for their proper-
ty, and a reward of one hundred dollars for
the recovery of goods stolen and five hundred
dollars for the capture and conviction of the
thieves, had been offered.
* * * *

Two months had passed by, no more being
heard of the robbers; and the people of Bol-
ton began to feel easier. Thus it was that the
parents of Bob Sikes and Sam Johnson gave
their consent to the boys going on a tramp
over the mountains and camping out over
night. Bob and Sam were chums; Bob was
five months the elder. Both were bright.
auick-witted lads and this trip was exactly
to their liking.

* * *

Early in the morning they set out in high
spirits. Each boy carried a generous stock of
provisions and a few camping necessities,
Toward noon they stopped in a shady grove
tor lunch. Soon there came up to them a
tramp, one of those worthless fellows who do
not know nor care where the next meal is
coming from. “Howdy, boys! Say, got a lit-
tle bite fer a hungry traveler?” The boys gave
him a sandwich and a drink of coffee and he
chattered away like a chipmunk. “I hear there
was some stealing goin’ on down at Bolton,”
said he. “About twenty years ago when I
lived in Jonesville ‘bout ten miles up the rail-
road, there was a gang of burglars ‘round
these parts and some detectives run ’em to
earth in a cave along the river somewhere
nigh here. There was a spring nearby and
they gobbled them when they came out for
water. Wouldn’t wonder much if this lot is
harborin’ in the same place. Well, so long,
young gents, I’ll be movin’ along.” After he
had gone out of sight, Sam said, “Say, Bob,
I wonder if there is any truth in what that
fellow said?”

“I don’t know,” answered Bob, “but what
do you say if we change our course a little
and go down along the river; if there is a cave
there, it would be jolly sport to find it even
if there were no robbers within ten miles of
it.” So it was settled and the boys set out
for the river,

After rambling through forests, along
ledges, over rocks, toward evening they came
upon a spring gushing out from the ground
and overhung by trees. “This is a fine place
go

to camp,” said Sam, “let’s stay here over
night.”

“Sam, that tramp said there was a spring
near that cave, didn't he? Let’s follow this
stream down toward the river, we might run
across it.”

They had gone about half way to the river,
when suddenly the one in advance exclaimed:

“Look, there is a foot-print! See, ere is a
fair little path. Let us follow it and see where
it leads.” When only a few yards down this
path, suddenly both boys were seized from
behind, gagged and dragged off.

Half walking and half carried along, the
boys were finally thrust through some tangled
bushes and into the hidden mouth of a cave.
This all happened so quickly that they scarce-
ly realized it until they became used to the
dim light and saw where they really were. The
cavern was about six feet high and three feet
wide, but just beyond where they were it made
a sudden turn to the left, so the prisoners
could not see much of it. Before them stood
their captors glaring down at them, two big
burly men who looked able to handle half a
dozen such people as the boys. “Well, young
*uns,” said one, “you put yer foot in it fer
sure this time. Thought you'd like to find
the cave, did yer? Well, be you satisfied now
you've found it? Reckon you’d better rest
easy till the captain comes in, there’s no tellin’
what he'll do to youse.”

After half an hour of anxious waiting on
the part of the boys, the chief came in. “Hello
Jimpson, what you got here?” “Couple of kids
rosin’ reund a little too close fer comfort,
sir.” “Now this is a pretty pickle; we can’t
keep them here or we'll soon have all the peo-
ple in the neighborhood swarming around
looking for them and we'll be found out. But
we'll get in a good job tonight down at old
Hurler’s, and tomorrow we'll skip. Come on,
let’s have a drink.” After a strong pull at a
black bottle, they ate some bread and corned
beef, then two of them stretched out and were

other two and after some whispered conver.

before, he all the time grumbling about hay.
ing to stay behind and keep meddlesome kids
from mischief.

After many pulls at the black bottle he sat
down on a stool in the mouth of the cave,
Slowly the time dragged; slowly the liquor
began to take effect; slowly his head sank
until he fell into a deep sleep. “Now’s our
time,” whispered Bob, “let’s work our way
out past him. Come on.”

Creeping on all fours, they approached the
sleeping guard, all the time fearful lest the
beating of their own hearts should arouse him,
His form nearly filled up the narrow way, but
they slowly edged by and were in open air.
“Now,” said Bob, “we'll run for the railroad
station and maybe we can capture these fel-
lows yet.”

Running, stumbling, falling, they came up
to the telegraph office. “What time does the
next train leave Montpelier for here?” they
inquired of the sleepy station agent. “In twen-
ty minutes.” “That’s all right. Here, we
want you to send a telegram to police head-
quarters there.” When the 2.45 a. m. train
rolled into Bolton, five men dropped silently
from the back car. Bob and Sam were on the
lookout and ran up to them.

“Well, youagsters, what will you have?”
said the leader. “It’s time you were in bed
Icng ago.” “O, we are the ones who sent you
the telegram,” Sam spoke out. “The deuce
you are! What do you know about this busi-
ness” Thereupon the boys told their story,
with nods of approval from the men. “Lead
us to their nest, boys, and we will catch the
hawks yet.”

They all made their way to the cave and
without much trouble captured the snoring
guard. Then they scattered about and waited

ior the return of the others, but whether they
were suspicious or had planned to leave that
part of the country without taking their com-
panion with them, was not known. At any
rate they were not seen that night nor ever
egain around Bolton.

As it was, some of the stolen goods were
found in the cave, one of the robbers was cap-
tured, and the band was broken up.

On Thursday evening, December twentieth,
Dr. Payson gave his sixteenth annual Christ-
mas banquet to the’pedple living at the Trap.
Although the weather’ outside was not pleas-

all the leading colleges were represented, but
in more prominence than others were the col-
ors of Rutgers Prep.

The climax of the sight was the tables. At
each person’s place was a small red candle,
burning in a dainty glass candlestick, and
tied with red ribbons to the latter were red
and green Christmas cards. These together
with the great bunches of holly on the tables
pave to the whole the air of a joyous Christ-
mas tide.

Everyone present seemed to enter into the
spirit of the occasion and between each course,
when Hendrickson and Lyall led off a familiar
song, all joined in, After an excellent turkey

ent responded to toasts. Beside these, of the
guests Mr. Burr and Mr. Street spoke. Mr.
Burr talked of the time when he was an in-
structor in Prep. School. He declared that al-
though the student events of his time were
excellent, the singing at the banquet went
ahead of the singing of the school when he
was teaching here.

Dr. Payson acted as toastmaster. The list
of the toasts and themes were:

y. Mr. Marcley—Rutgers College.

t “That dear old College is all the world
to me.”

2. Mr. Mitchell—Foot-Ball.

“Whoop ’er up for Rutgers Prep.

3. Mr. Romeike—Camping.

“There's an awful lot of knowledge

That you never get at College,

And a lot of things you never learn at

4. Mr. Neff—Study Hour.

“How dear to my heart!”

5. Mr. Black—Examinations.

“A little learning is a dangerous thing.”

Winter is at hand, ice has been quite plenti-

it will be good; a hockey team is what we
want. Let a new branch of athletics be started
in our school. It will be well to add interest
to the winter term/\ We have several good
players in schgol more who would soon
prove themselvéso be good players. Let each
class have a team and play for school cham-
pionship. As there is little doubt but that the
teams would be nearly equally matched, it
would arouse enthusiasm and prove itself a
great sport. The game is not expensive; it
needs no covered floor, no costly outfit. Skat-

MARCLEY’S TOAST.

 

Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentlemen:

Rutgers College is such that it is surely no
small honor to have one’s name mentioned in
connection with it. It stands apart from oth-
er institutions of its kind in point of ability
to turn out strong men and in regard to ‘its
age. Out of the six hundred colleges in the
country there are but seven older than Rut-
gers. It was preceeded by Harvard, Williams
and Mary, Yale, Princeton, Kings, Pennsyl-
yania and Brown.

Founded in 1766, it seems to have had its
struggle for existence, on account of laci< of
supporters and on account of the proximity
of the war. In 1782 we find in its history
that in the senior class there were but four
students, one in the junior, one in the sopho-
more, and twelve in the freshman class. But
it is the old story of small beginnings. From
the acorn the great tree has grown and as it
has flourished what a power it has become!
Although it is not yet as large as some col-
leges, it is all the better for that. Quantity
of college does not mean quality of college.
I believe it is well understood nowadays, that
the time of large colleges is over; authorities
now claim that the typical college is one
about the size of Rutgers. You know things
are not always what thev seem. I imagine
that young men wlio go to the largest col-
lege they can find, frequently come away with
« big head, but with not much in it. We
never knew anything like that to happen at
Rutgers. On the contrary when you see a
Rutgers man you can make up your mind
that, no matter whether he has a big head or
not, he has something in it. As a proof of
this I refer to our former instructor, Mr.
Scott, or to the debating team which has to its
credit eighteen victories out of eighteen suc-
cessive debates.

More than this, when you consider the pos-
sibilities in the line of athletics in the small

41

college, the balance goes down farther still
on the side of Rutgers. In the large colleges
the real object of athletics is often lost sight
of through stress of rivalry and lust of vic-
tory. Here I want to make a comparison be-
{ween our foot-ball team and Rutgers College .
team in regard to their character. ‘They say
that on the college team they used Boose a
great deal all the season, and during a rainy
time they had a Fisher to go around to look
after the men. We had nothing of this kind,
but 1 will admit that one of our men was
Black and another was a little Micky.

I wish I were a Daniel Webster, an Albert
P. Mills, or a Henry Clay, in order that I
might speak more forcibly my feelings in re-
gard to Rutgers College. While 1 am not
in reality a Rutgers man, at heart my sym-
pathy is with this, the Star of New Jersey,
the fountain of knowledge, the mighty trainer
of men, the everlasting standard of righteous-
ness and truth.

 

GROSS’S TOAST.

Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentlemen:

I find the subject I have in hand a difficult
one because of the great field to be covered
in such a short time. But I will say this; we
have some great talent here at the Trap and
some not so great. Often we hear Wyckoff
grating at the piano, then we are reminded
ot the fact that we have some great talent.
Again we hear strange thrilling notes pour-
ing forth from the music room, then we are
reminded that all the Robins have not gone
South. Often sounds are heard in the vicinity
of room 26 that remind one very much of a
Hen.

As I have told you about some of the great
talent we have, I will say something about our
talent which is not so great. Surely much of
the joy would be taken from our life here at
the trap if we had not the privilege of spend-
ing a little time every day for music. Some
cne has said, “Music hath charms to calm the
THE
eral pledges which we think should be taken
pave come to our minds. Now it is prob-
able that many of these people have already
adopted resolutions similar, but nevertheless
we will mention them for the benefit of those
who have not.

Be it Resolved:

By Hendrickson—to get a new laugh. We
all know his old one.

By F, Gross—Always to close the door of
his room after study hour. Otherwise he dis-
turbs the deep meditation and total quiet of
the English instructor.

By Baumann—to- take all theatre programs
out of his pockets before coming to school. It

looks as if he burned midnight oil for a wrong

purpose.

By Koehler—to take up a weight reducing
series of exercise.

by Campbell—to take up another kind of
series.

By Mr Powell—to let alone the faucet
the laboratory sink during his lectures. At
this rate it will be worn out before school

in

1958 MARKS CAGERS’
GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY
by Richard Smith
Rutgers Prep 1908
The fall of 1907 saw the close of
one of the finer Rutgers Prep football
seasons. As I recall, we won six games

and lost but one.
With

of us at

 

this example the thoughts of

school turned to winter

all
sports and to basketball.

BASKETBALL A POPULAR SPORT
FIFTY YEARS AGO
Fifty years ago basketball was a
popular winter sport, of course, but at
that time had not gained the prom-
inence it enjoys today, but it was still
one of the finest winter sports. The
center jump after each basket was the
rule then and possibly the game was |
not as fast as today, but we felt it |
was a grand game, as it still is, and
perhaps the center jump had some
advantages.

FIRST TEAM FACED OBSTACLES

Rutgers Prep never had been repre-
sented by a basketball team, but after
our footbal] some
of us who had played basketball pre-
viously went to see Headmaster Dr.
E. R. Payson and suggested to him
that we put a team in the field. He
quickly agreed but that

We had a good turn-out for practice

none too good. The regular team se-

I Gross, Todd, and Watson played

was a lot of school spirit and a fine
professor who had coached our foot

he would be glad to coach our team.
Prof. Hall, “Unc” to us, really helped
and started us on our way.

COMMUNITY SPIRIT HELPED
TEAM

For a practice gym we secured per-
mission to play at the Seminary Gym
“Holy Hill”, and while no doubt],
it was built for everything except] ,
basketball, we rigged up a basket at
each end, dodged the large posts,
which were built in two rows so that
they left a twenty foot isle in the mid-
dle, and practice began. I'm sure the

were as many fouls, but either they

there were no dressing rooms, and
after all, dressing on the floor didn’t

and dodging posts twenty-four inches

arranged with the College (not a uni-
versity at that time) Athletic Associa-
tion to play between the halves of the
Rutgers Varsity games in the Ballan

destroyed by fire. This worked out
exceedingly well, particularly so, since
an informal dance which we all enjoyed
was in order after the game.

the school has its famous quintet,
ably backed up by seniors Bruce
Gunkle, Arthur (Monkey) Feldman
and Mel Hamelsky. The rules have
changed, but the spirit hasn't. The
3ame'’s speed has increased, and the
high scores attest to modifications
in the type of tactics of the game.

Thanks to the interest of Richard
A. Smith, one of the alumni of 1908,
we have the picture of the first
team, which appears on this page,
and also the article to the left, Mr.
Smith sent.a copy of an old Argo

rary for student use. This Argo, in
magazine form, has many interesting
ads advertising wares of fifty years

Dear Linda,

Belgium is the most beautiful
country there is to see from the air.
The farmlands form a perfect patch-
work surrounding the small villages.

The city of Bruxelles (Frenct
spelling) has buildings dating as
far back as 1400. The center of town
(one block from where I am stay-
ing) is in the form of a large square.
This square is surrounded by very
old buildings which gilded in
gold and silver. The floor of the
Square is made of old bricks, carved
from solid stone. Standing in this
old square, one is reminded of olden
times, with its different sights and
people.

I am staying in a hotel which was
once a Spanish jail. This was when
Belgium was part of the Spanish
Netherlands. The Hotel Amigo (that
is what it is called) got its name
during this Spanish rule. When
someone escaped from the jail, the
guards would run after him shout-
ing, “Amigo! Amigo!" To this ¥;

also speedy room service, something
rarely found in Ame hotels. I
will give you an example of what I

(3:00 P.M. Bruxelles time), I
dropped a hair brush on the room

pick it up when there was a soft
knock on the door. I opened the door
and there was a man in a green
uniform standir there. My first
thought was, “What do the police
want with me?” But he cleared
away my fear by saying, “You

Letters to the Editor

Dear Editor:

Although it is extremely hard to
criticize one’s fellow students and
friends, I feel that some constructive
criticism must be given, There are
two things in the Argo which could
stand a little improvement. First, I
have noticed that some articles in
the paper are constantly interrupted
by all sorts of Subheadlines, which,

I think, try to summarize the sub-
sequent paragraphs. I understand

that this is a newspaper practice,
but even so, I think that, if these
headlines must be kept, they should
be improved.

Secondly, I have read the column
Mare Time now for two issues, and
though it is a good idea, it is lack-
ing in quality. Knowing the author
of the articles personally, as well
as his style of writing, I expected
much more from the article than
I have so far received. The trouble
Seems to lie in the fact that either
the themes chosen for the column
are much too superficial (the Pogo
theme), or if they are serious (the
Shakespeare theme) they are pre-
sented in a very purile fashion, For
example, sentences like “Shake-
speare is worth reading,” seem to
me a bit too trite and useless. The

column, moreover, seems to lack
cohesion,

I hope that you and the author
will accept this criticism, for it is
siven with good intentions.

Sincerely,
D. Struck

Marc Time

by Mare Leavitt

In this holiday season it is ap-
Propriate to deal with a much loved
classic. I refer to Charles Dickens’
A Christmas Carol. Of all the many
Christmas books, I think, and jus-
tifiably so, that this is the warmest
and most beloved.

The book has captivated the imag-
inations of succeeding generations
for over a century. This is a work
which holds the principles of
brotherhood and love as living fore-
es, rather than abstractions,

“Bah! Humbug!”

Miserly Scrooge’s transformation
into a jolly old humanitarian is a
beautifully wrought theme. Scrooge
has allowed the gold lust to cast a
film over his inherently good quali-
ties, which should manifest them-
selves at Christmastide. When his
improvident nephew wishes him the
metriest of Christmases, Scrooge re-
torts, “What right have you to be
merry? What reason have you to
be merry? You're poor enough,”
and the nephew answers, “What
right have you to be dismal? What
reason have you to be morose?
You're rich enough.” Scrooge has
no answer to this sally save his
habitual, “Bah! Humbug!”

After this encounter, Scrooge
wends his penurious way homeward
to a frugal bowl of gruel in his
shabby lodgings, where he has a
visitation from the unhappy ghost
of his old partner Jacob Marley,
“dead these seven years.” The spec-
tre warns him of three spirits,
through whom Scrooge may escape
Marley’s plight of walking abroad
like Hamlet’s father,

The spirits soon visit him. They
are the spirits of Christmas Past,
Present, and Christmas Yet to
Come. By showing Scrooge Christ-
mases related to himself, the Spirits
make him realize that his only sal-
vation lies in renouncing his parsi-
monious ways and performing good
in his latter years.

When the last spirit departs,
Scrooge sets himself to the task of
spreading good will among his fel-
lows. Dickens writes, “It was alw ays
said of him that he knew how to
keep Christmas well, if any man
alive possessed the knowledge.”

 

 

“God bless us, everyone!”
For me this book has always been
the essence of Christmas. I think

IN THIS
CORNER

by Paul Gottlieb

The basketball season is now in
full swing, and from the looks of
things, the student body has “got-
ten hep and is backing Prep.’ The
stands have been filled with spirited
fans and excitement has run high.
The cheerleaders now have someone
to lead, and it must be a relief for
them to know that their lung power
is not being wasted. The student
body should be congratulated for its
support, and we hope it will con-
tinue to back the team.

Hoffman Game

Those who attended the game
against Hoffman High on December
11 witnessed one of the most excit-
ing games in Prep history. Delirious
fans cheered as the lead changed
hands many times. All sorts of stra-
tegy went into effect and excitement
was at its peak. Finally, though,
Hoffman managed to pull ahead by
two points, and, leaving no time for
the “Prep Five” to even it up, won
the game. All players fought hard
and were fine representatives of
their school. “Monkey” Feldman
netted 33 points as high scorer, and
Bruce Gunkle came close behind
with 27. Had he not fouled out in
the last quarter, Bruce may have
increased this total.

Varsity Defeats Alumni Quintet, 64-45

Prep witnessed the greatest alumni function in its history on December
20, 1958. The idea, orginally conceived as one of Mr. O'Connell's “brain-
storms” flowered into a new alumni bulletin and a gala dinner party with
the cheerleaders in full regalia acting as hostesses.

Although an alumni game has always been listed on Prep’s schedule,
it had usually been a slip-shod affair. This year, however, Mr. O'Connell!
devised the scheme of inviting the 1937-’38 Champions and the 1955-"
winners to play a game against the current varsity. Managing to get con-
nections for their publicity, Mr. O'Connell and Bardy Levavy hunted up the
alumni to photograph them. Then the Varsity “R" Club took over

   

The “R” Club, under the leadership of Mr. Sperduto and “Monk” Feld-
man, took care of the other details. Food, lights and the addressing and
mailing of envelopes and post cards to every alumnus of the last fifty-eight
years were taken care of in record time, After the final arrangements had
all been taken care of, the party took place and was a great success

 

After the dinner Bruce Gunkle and his boys easily beat the Alumni
64-45, thus capping one of the finest Prep functions in recent years

PREP THREATENS

After a few rounds of alternate
scoring, Prep threatened and closed
to within five points of the oppo-

By the end of the third period, Croy-

quarter with neither squad gaining
the advantage, although Prep was
close behind, Croydon Hall thwarted
the Prepsters and maintained their
lead, thus winning the game.

Neither team bolstered a
mendable defense, preferring to £0
for the tallies instead. As a result,
the competition was spirited and the

Delegates Bring Back Reports

The school’s three delegates, Linda Levy, Danylo Struk, and Bruce
Miller brought back reports which were strikingly similar. Mr. Struk and
Miss Levy reported that the discussions which they attended seemed to
have more to do with a larger school than with one our size. Mr. Miller,
in giving his report, outlined several ideas garnered from the meeting.
Unfortunately, most of his ideas Were also impractical for a school the

whether or not we would continue our membership in the association,

Disciplinary Program Goes Into Action

During the month, Mr. Dumarae informed the Council that it had
lost some of its prestige with the students because of several misdemeanors
and laxities. To combat this, the Council inaugurated a disciplinary pro-
gram from which no one was exempt, and which seems to have gone far
in correcting the school problem. The plan has been explained to the
students and need not be reiterated here. This seems to have added to
the prestige of the Council.

The Council has continued its policy of a more active social schedule.
A dance has been planned for February 14, and another one for April is
in the planning stage. Mr. Struk is also pressing the junior class for more

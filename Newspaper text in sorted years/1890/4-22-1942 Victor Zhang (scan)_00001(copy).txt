also gone a long way in putting

of eight full pages of candid came

Mikado” Producer
Gives Interview

While attending the Columbia P:
Conference in New York, your ‘ARGO
reporter was fortunate ¢ woth to at-
tend the opening of the Gilbert and
Sullivan comic opera MIKADO at the
Cherry Lane Theatre, which is a very
small playhouse hidden somewhere in
the depths of Greenwich village. It is
so small that a crowd of two hundred
completely fills the hall. Nor does it
make any pretensions at elegance—the
orchestra consists of one piano, played
sometimes by one and sometimes by
two persons. The stage is a vaguely
rectangular hole hewn in, one wall of
itori ly covered
y sewn curtain. However,
in spite of these little defects, as well
as a conservation of scenery and cos-
tumes, the production was éxceedingly
good. Perhaps it was the
hall, or perhaps the vi
actors; somehow the spectator ees
to be living the play himself.
further add to the novelty of the si it
ation, about half of the audience knew
the play by heart, and was repeating
lines and singing songs along with the
players!

‘At intermission, instead of standing
around in the lobby, the whole audi-
ence of two hundred trouped upstairs
to a small, low lounge, where free
fruitade was being served to all who
wished it. However, the most interest-
ing tor of the intermission was not
the refreshments but the walls of the
lounge. These were almost completely
covered over with old playbills adver-
tising other Gilbert and Sullivan pre-
mieres, comic cartoons by W. S. Gil-
bert both in the original and reproduc-
tions, and similar material. Perhaps
the most interesting single item was a
scrapbook filled with old envelopes.

ENGLISH PRIZE

Each year an English prize is of-
fered by the Rutgers Preparatory
School for the best original pl
poem, essay, or similar piece of writ-
ing submitted. The entries are
judged completely impartially, usual-
ly by some member of the Rutgers
aculty, and the best piece
of writing is elected as winner, The
results are never known until the
day of Commencement, when they
are announced in chapel along with
the other prizes.

While as yet there has been no
deadline set on applications and en-
tries, it is advisable for all contest-
ants to start work immedia
that the greatest possible amount of
time may be ilable for revision,
rewriting, and other points of com-
position. he only restriction is that
all entries must be typewritten, dou-
ble space, on plain typewt
paper.

and student editors head round-table
discussions in) which one ticular

 

p
phase of newspaper work is Hiscussed.
In this way each editor may bring
forth his problem and learn how other
papers have solved it. In_ addition,
executives and writers of the large New
Y newspapers speak before open
professional journaliam. In other words,
the prime purpose of the convention is
that each delegate may receive helpful
ideas and thus improve the quality of
his pape! The wide variety of sec-
tional meetings enables each Prep dele-
gate to attend the one which interests
him most. Finally, each of the three
boys exchanges and compares notes.

The highlight of the convention was
the final banquet, held at the Hotel
Commodore. Among the leading speak-
ers was Alice Marble, outstanding ten-
nis player. Miss Marble and the other
speakers placed their accent on the
national defense program, and urged
the student editors to stimulate as much
as possible the purchase of defense
bonds and stamps among the students.
Methods of stimulating their purchase
were mentioned throughout the con-
ference.

Greenville, South Carolina.

In Nyack, New York at Mount

BUCKLE DOWN!

_As this issue goes to press, the school year is embarking upon the
spring term, the final two months before graduation. This is the most
important period of the year; the period when those boys who are
hanging on the line bewteen passing and failing or between certifying
and not certifying or between making the Honor Roll and not making
it have the opportunity to come through with flying colors. Likewise,
it is unfortunately the period which offers the greatest temptation with

its fine weather and its lure to pla,
___ These two months bring to a conclusion the work of the year and
inaugurate the short period of review before the final e which
count a full third on a boy's fir rk. These final aminations,
with their great importance, offer a splendid opportunity for every

boy to pull his yearly mark up tremendously. This is a chance which
no one can afford to miss.

 

 
      

 

 

 

 

 

Not enough has been said about the importance of getting a good
education in these critical times, and not enough can be said about
taking advantage of this particular period. The future of many
students may hinge on the work which they can accomplish in these
two months. There are about fifteen prizes to be given out at com-
mencement, to say nothing of the diplomas, and competition is open
until the final day.

Every boy has much to gain by increased study these next two
months. Certainly it is the time to buckle down!

 

WHY AREN’T YOU IN IT?

Admittedly, a school as small as ours has little chance to carry
on an extensive extra-curricular program. We can in no way hope to
compete with the large high schools with their Chess Clubs, Travel
Clubs, Book Clubs, and other activities, but we can and do have a few
things of a similar type. For instance, there is the annual Rutgers
University concert series, for which we are allowed tickets. But how
many boys finally subscribe? Possibly ten—no more. And yet, this
series features some of the greatest musical artists in the world today.
The Boston Symphony Orchestra, possibly the greatest in the world,
gives a performance each year. Marion Anderson and Paul Robeson
have both presented concerts. Yet very few of the students ever at-
tend these.

One of the most interesting activities of the school is the Theatre
Club. This group attends some of the best Broadway plays cach year
—plays which are later made into best-selling movies. Yet, in spite of
the superior choices of the group, only about a half-dozen boys are in
the least interested. In the last year and a half, such outstanding hits
as LIFE WITH FATHER, THE CORN IS GREEN, and the Evans
production of MACBETH are among the productions attended. Why
isn’t this group larger? —

Around the school itself, there are the two school publications,
the ARGO and YE DIAL. The newspaper has openings for only a
dozen or so boys on the staff at most, but even at that the quota i
hard to fill. And yet, it is undoubtedly excellent training in writing
and journalism. YE DIAL has openings on its three staffs—advertis-
ing, editorial, and photographic, yet hardly anyone shows any interest
in the book. Perhaps these apparent signs of disinterest are merely
indications of ignorance of school activities, but whatever the answer
is, more people should join these groups. If it is too late for some
of these things this vear, it is about time to start thinking of next
year’s program .

THE BOOKWORM ...

GENESEE FEVER
Farrar and Rinchart by Carl Cramer

The land of GENESEE FEVER is
upstate New York, the Genesee coun-
try where, after the Revolution had
been won, the cause for which it was
fought was lost, and where dwelt in
wild disharmony more strange and
diverse people than could be found in
any other place throughout the land.
Also, something of importance in an
historical novel, the characters and ac-
tions of historical characters are ac-
curately and correctly drawn.

Throughout the pages of the book,
one_of the most important characters
is Colonel Williamson, America’s first
real estate agent, who operates in a
wilderness parcelling out plots of land
to everyone who can be cajoled into
purchase by the silvery smoothness of
his tongue. He had been at one time
an officer in the British Army,
afterwards became a citizen of thi
country, although he had aristocratic
tendencies, He believes sincerely in
the great future of the country, but
also feels that the only just and true
government is one ruled by the aris-
tocracy. Because of this feeling, so
hostile to the spirit of the times, he is
at first held in some suspicion, a sus-
picion which increases when he trie:
to set up a community for gentlemen
only in the valley. The great country
fair, given by Williamson to attract
wealthy buyers to the district, is a high
spot of the book.

The hero of the story is a young
schoolmaster named Nathan "Hart.
Nathan's pity is always for the under-
dog, and since his temper is none too
good, he soon gets into trouble. In his
home county the whiskey tax was at
that time a much hated institution.
The government had placed a high tax
on liquor—so high, in fact, that it was
no longer profitable for the farmers

 

  
 

 

 

 

 

    

 

   

 

 

to transport their corn crop across the
mountains. As a result, a minor re-

 

 

bellion started, in which Nathan was
ightly involved. He was arrested by
federal officers, but soon escaped, and
fled to the Genesee country, where he
settled.

One of the most
in the book is wh:

nds. The leader

PREP BASEBALL SQUAD PROMISES TO HAVE
ONE OF ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL SEASONS

The Rutgers Prep 1942 baseball sea-
son opened with a turnout of some
thirty-five candidates. After several
days of preliminary practice, Coach
Petke began forming his varsity squad.
With but three lettermen returning
from last year’s team, and two of these
outfielders, there remains much work
to be done in the infield.

 

On the mound staff returning from
the ‘41 squad is Bob Clothier, left
hander, who turned in several credit-
able relief assignments last year. Also
bidding for starting assignments are
George Nebel, John Linder and Al
Evans. Johnny and Al were both mem-
bers of Varsity teams prior to enter-
ing Prep School, Johnny earned his
letters at New Brunswick High, while
Al was a starting pitcher for Westfield
High.

Bob Havens, member of Rutherford
High varsty in "41, is taking over the
position behind the plate. With power
assured in our starting batteries, we
turn toward the more difficult prob-
lems in the infield. At first base we
have captain George Mederer with
Bill “Rebel” Wurzburger a runner-up
for the position. Second base is being
hotly contested between Emery Toth,

omii Lategano, and Gordon Dun-
ham. Emery “Remy” Toth started in
the teams first practice game and

Defunct After
Promising Start

 

This Spring the tennis team of Rut-
gers Preparatory School looked very
bright, but the picture has become
steadily darkened. The tennis team
is now defunct. Mr. Matthews was
named coach, and practice was started
in the gymnasium. Then one by one
the best prospects joined the other
sports: baseball and golf.

The recent surprise storm which hit
New Brunswick just as Spring seemed
to have really come, put the tennis
courts in bad repair. Unfortunately
the University is unable at present to
resurface them. The damage done by
the storm was particularly lamentable
since shortly before the team had been
called together by Mr. Matthews to put
the courts in the best shape possible.

Instead of playing tennis the boys
will play soft-ball. So far everybody
is enthusiastic. It seems probable that
for the remainder of the year soft-ball
rather than tennis will be one of the
prominent sports at Rutgers Prep.

    

SPRING DANCE SUCCESSFUL

of the students have spent since the
last Prep dance. The capable com-
mittee consisted of the same nine boys
who were on the committee for the fall
dance. They were: Ray Ries, Bob
Schweitzer, Bill Pfaff, Jim Lategano,

Fred Howell, George Ziegler, Mac
Wells, George Mederer, and Ted
Minde. The money matters of the

dance were taken care of by David
Beardslee, the school treasurer, The
gymnasium was decorated as it was
at the fall dance with the furniture
from the dorms arranged around the
hall, college pennants adorning the
walls, and maroon and white drapes
providing an interesting decoration for
the ceiling.

The chaperones for the dance were:
Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Shepard Jr., Mr.
and Mrs. Harry E. Rudy, Mr. and Mrs.
Benjamin A. Matthews Jr., Mrs. George
C. Andrews, Mr. Andreas Z. Holley,
and Mr. Guy F. Blake.
, The dance was a semi-formal affair
with the girls coming in formal attire
and most of the boys coming in

 

 

 

 

 
  

 

 

 

tuxedoes. Several of the girl guests of

Johnny Muench and Phil Ruegger are
battling away for the starting position
with perhaps their hitting ability to
decide the contest. Bill Pfaff, regular
third baseman from last year’s team
and Bob Plitt are wrangling over the
third base position, both marked

ing of the infield with competition the

ciding the best combinations among
the candidates.

The outfield is being patrolled by two
erans, Howard Woodruff and Dick
farkas with Bob Deming and Don
Conhagen pressing hard for the vacant
position. Outfield Coach Roy has done
much to strengthen the outfield as was
shown in the first practice game with
Rutgers University freshmen on Tues-
day April 14th. It was clearly evident
that the Prep school power lies in its
mound staff, who allowed a few scat-
tered hits throughout the game. The
infield showed signs of lack of ex-
perience more than anything else by
committing several costly errors. How-
ever, as the game progressed the in-
field settled down and took the form
of the powerhouse infield of the previ
ous year. There was a decided weak-
ness shown in the teams offense but
this was more than accounted for by
the base-running of the ones who did
get on base.

GOLF TEAM SHOWS
UP WELL DURING
EARLY PRACTICE

  

  

 

 

Under the tutelage of Coach Harry
Rudy, a promising squad of Rutgers
Prep linksmen took to the golf course
immediately following the spring vaca-
tion to begin drills for the coming
season, which commences on April 24,
with a match with the Hun School.

The golfers appear headed for a
successful campaign because of the
quantity of the aspirants and the fine
early cards turned in by many of them.
At present, the squad is led by Bob
Schweitzer, Danny Williams, and Jerry
Taub while Bob Howard, Horace Hes-
son, Mike Ward, Harold Hancock, and
Dick Sexton also show promise.

Practice during the first few weeks
has been confined to coaching by Mr.
Rudy on fundamentals such as grip
of the club, stance, and stroke. In
addition, many of the players have
been holding matches with teammates
and members of the faculty, who have
been accompanying the linksmen on
their excursions to the Rutgers course.

 

the boarding students stayed overnight
at the Gamma House, which had been
fixed up for their use.

The music which was strictly “out
of this world”, was supplied by that
fine aggregation, the Princetonions who
have played at all the Prep dances for
the last two years. The band began
playing at 1 o'clock, and closed up
at one. They played all the popular
numbers of the day as well as a rhumba,
a conga, and of course, “Deep in the
Heart of Texas”. The sweet strains
of “Home Sweet Home” sent them on
their ways finally,

By far the outstanding interest of
the entire evening was the stupendous
entertainment which some of the stu-
dents and their girls put on during the
intermission. This unusual entertain-
ment was introduced by Mr. Matthews
and had been directed by Mr. Holley.
The first act was a dance given by the
champion jitterbugs of Brooklyn and
Jersey City, jive crazy “Dommie” Late-
gano and lovely George Ziegler, dressed
in a very snug skirt a a fetching
tight. sweater. The pair jived around
for five minutes to that “hep” music
supplied by the Rutgers Prep trio com-

Prep Five Suffers
Second Morristown
Defeat, 33-19

Williams and Mederer
Battle Valiantly As
Prep Loses

 

 

‘The Prep basketball five traveled to
Morristown where they suffered a
crushing defeat at the hands of Mor-
mstown Academy courtsters, Although
Vrep fought valiantly, a determined
Academy squad subdued them by a
score of 33-19.

Bill Main, the captain of the Morris-
town courtsters led the opponents at-
tack by sinking a long set shot, a few
seconds after the opening whistle. He
was followed by Al Ryan who dropped
one in from beneath the Prep basket,
but George Mederer quickly retaliated
for the Prep five by looping the ball
through the hoop for two points.
Mashan and Main then bombarded the
Prep basket and managed to run up a
considerable lead for Morristown be-
fore the period ended.

The second quarter saw the Prep
school boys return with a momentary
rally as Dan Williams and Bob Plitt
each swished the ball through the net
and Bob Schweitzer sank a foul shot.
But it was not enough to overcome the
lead of Morristown which was kept in
tact by Meshan, Regan, and Main. As
the half ended Prep was on the short
end of a twenty to fourteen score.

In the third quarter, Morristown con-
tinued its winning ways while Prep
struggled to no avail to halt the op-
ponent’s attack. George Mederer sunk
two baskets for Prep, and Main and
Travers followed each with one for
Morristown. ‘
_ Travers led the Morristows ad
in the last quarter, swishing one long
field goal and two foul shots. Al Evans
tallied for Prep from the side court and
as the closing whistle blew Tom Bishop
looped the sphere through the net to
make the final score 33-19.

mensely,

Mr. and Mrs. Shepard remained
quietly at home, and took dinner with
friends a few times. It was necessary
for Mr. Shepard to be at the office dur-
ing the week.

Lastly we have Mr. and Mrs. Rudy.
Since Mrs. Rudy works, she didn’t
have a vacation, and Mr. Rudy in his
own words, “played domestic for a
week”; he made beds at ten o'clock
and started supper promptly at four
im the afternoon, with the potato sans
jackets.

Also the student body returned on
the thirtieth. Some of the boys came
from such far-away places as Michi-
gan, Deleware, and Virginia. On re-
turning the boarding school received a
new student, Harold Hancock, who
was formerly a day boy.

Argo Staff Again
Plans To Print
Literary Issue

 

Work of Superior Quality
From all Students To
Be Included Therein

 

 

Each year one edition of the Argo
has a hterary supplement which is
made up of stories and anecdotes writ-
ten by various students. This year is
no exception. The last Argo will have
a literary supplement. For weeks Mr.
tlunter and the other English teachers
have been diligently scanning each
theme and composition in the endeavor
to nnd enough stories of high quality
to fill four extra pages of the paper,
“Success has been long in coming,
ay the teachers, but as teachers are
usually very critical about their pupils’
abilities; this may be taken with a grain
of salt.

To get a story in the
plement is an honor. It

of a passing ig
latter would be greatly appreciated by
a goodly number of the school’s stu-
dents.

Stories are not the only acceptable
literary work. Poems have been used
occasionally. Since this is true, all the
budding young Miltons and Longfel-

 

erary sup-

   
    

 

 

lows are invited to submit a sample of
their work.

Each literary supplement is greeted
with enthusiasm by the students who
are eager to see their own or thei
friends’ masterpieces in print. This
enthusiasm soon dies down, but an
honest interest in the pieces printed
replaces it.

In past

 

years the supplement has

success.

 

THEATRE INTERVIEW
(Continued from Page 1)

and the PIRATES OF
NCE. Each had been mailed
from a town having something to do
with the play.

Naturally, so interesting a scoop was
impossible to overlook, so after the
play was over, your ARGO reporter
moseyed his way back stage to inter-
view the members of the cast_and the
leaders. Here he met_the Dramatic
Director, Mr. Lewis Denison. The
latter very kindly sat down and an-
swered questions fired at him for al-
most an hour.

The ultimate aim of the troupe is to
become a full-sized, full-time organiza-
tion, but so far it is ni-amateur,
with the cast earning their livings in
other ways. Because of this, it is im-
possible to rehearse in the day ‘time.
The only way they can rehearse is by
sacrificing some of their money-earn-
ing evenings. For this reason, they
give shows only three nights a we
and use the rest of their time in re-
hearsals.

Because their time is in this manner
so completely taken up, the major social
life of the pl: s has to do with the
theatre group. hus it is a more com-
pact and_ self-contained organization
than many. For instance, the cast
issues a wee mimeographed paper.
Also, there are frequent concerts for
the group by members of the Phil-
harmonic who come down on Sunday
evenings. In all, the Savoy Opera
Guild, as the group is called, seems
more like a one-family undertaking,
with everyone working for the common
good, than anything else.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Beta House Changes
Brighten Up School

The Beta House has taken on a new
popularity on the Rutgers Prep
campus; the reason is the recent addi-
tion of new furniture in the Commons
Room. Practically every night, both
before and after dinner, there is a
greater swarm of humanity than one
would usually expect.

The whole room has been improved
immensely by the five easy chairs and
the two ‘sofas which are now there.
Because of their bright red leather
covering, the new furniture seems to
make the room more colorful and
cheerful. The furniture will be lasting
because surely no one would want to
leave his

 

 

 

 
   

not-so-clean foot prints on
them so that others would point a
guilty finger in the culprit’s

ace.
_ If you are apt not to believe all, that
is said above, the best thing is to
visit the Beta House for your own
satisfaction.

 

 

Honor Roll Enlarged
As Work Improves

The honor roll of the Rutgers Pre-
paratory School for the month of Feb-
ruary consists of twenty names
The fourteen seniors, three junior:
seven sophomores, and two freshmen
on the roster are mainly boys who have
been consistent honor students; how-
ever, a few new names have been added.

Mr. Shepard, the headmaster, ¢:
pressed a feeling of cheer as he an-
nounced the honor roll, since
names, including that of Fernando Car-
bonell of Colombia, South America,
had been added to the honor roll. Mr.

rd did regret the absence of the

just topped Dave Beardsice's mark of
93.5. These two boys have been friend-
ly rivals throughout the year in a war
that benefits both of them.

In order to attain an honor status,
the student must have an average of
cighty or better, and a certifying grade
of at t seventy-five in each of his
subjects. Honorable mention is given
to students who have attained averages
of better than eighty, but who have
failed to certify in one course.

| New Classroom Meets
With Approval Of All

 

A new classroom is being finished off

in the basement of the recitation build-

-rep to accommodate a hea’
aeedule ot classes. The capacity will
increase from thirty-six to forty-two
classes a day.

This room, completed except for per-
manent light fixtures, is eighteen by
twenty-two feet and by far the best-
looking classroom in the building. The
walls are of light pine paneling and the
floor is covered with a red and black
checkered asbestos tile.

The room now has ten desks (total
possible number being twenty) and
takes care of Spanish If and Algebra [
first and fifth periods respectively.
When the finishing touches have been
completed, other classes, not yet de-
cided upon, will also be held here.

PRESS CONFERENCE ATTENDED

Dave French, editor of Ye Dial anda
member of the Argo staff, was especial-
ly interested in the meetings on the
publication of yearbooks, and these he
attended. Rex Miller was more in-
terested in meetings in which new an-
gles in feature writing were discussed,
while Bob Beaudette, editor of the
«lrgo, made the meetings about edi-
torial writing the object of his attend-
ance. All three boys agreed that the
meetings were extremely helpful. Those
new ideas received and accepted will
be used in the concluding issues of this
year’s Argo.

While not attending the conference
meetings during the daytime, the boys
enjoyed the sights of New York. From
their headquarters at the Hotel Well-
ington, the boys took a tour of the
RCA building, and saw several movies
and shows. In addition, Beaudette and

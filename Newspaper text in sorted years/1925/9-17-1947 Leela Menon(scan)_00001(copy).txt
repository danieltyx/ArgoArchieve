THE ARGO

This issue of THE ARGO revives one
of the oldest and most important
activities of the school. In 1889
the first copy hit the news stands,
It continued to appear practically
without a break until the recent
war.

Although originally a monthly lit-
erary magazine, many other fea-
tures were added from time to time,
By 1914 it had become a newspaper
in form’ and purpose with’ columns
of news, sports, reviews, and car-
toons. By 1925 its original eight
page format had grown to twenty-
eight,

THE ARGO was in the past an out-
standing feature of the school and
this issue has been prepared in

the belief that it could and should
continue,

What do you think?

Would-be journalists, artists,
sports writers, speak up} The
staff remains to be chosen from
those of you who step forward,
There's much to be done, much fun
to be had, If you are interested
in developing your skill as a news-
paperman, in "seeing yourself in
print", give your name to Mr.Lowe
or to'lr. Martin. YE DIAL pros-
pects, here's your opportunity to
get that extra experience.

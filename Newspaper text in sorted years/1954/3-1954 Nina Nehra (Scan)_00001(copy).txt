New York Trip
Enables Prep
To See U. N.

On Thursday, March 18, the student
body went to New York to attend a
session of the United Nations. The stu-
dents went in two buses, which left at
different times. The number of students
was divided approximately in half with
half going at eight-thirty in the morning
and the rest leaving at noon.

After spending all morning at the
United Nations building, those who had
come on the first bus went to visit the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. There
they ate lunch in the new restaurant,
which has a lovely pool in the center.
Following lunch they split up and went
to see various exhibits in the museum
until three-thirty, when the bus returned
to take them home.

The Prepsters who left on the twelve
o'clock bus did not get a chance to visit
the museum of art. The earlier bus ar-
rived home at five, and those on the later
bus were home at a quarter of six.

Mr. Heinlein and Mr. Holley directed
the groups and supervised the visits
through the United Nations building. Mr.
Holley attended the first bus, along
with Mr. Dumarae and Mr. Moffat. Mr.
Gaggini and the O’Connells went on the
second bus.

Mr. Dumarae planned and implemented
the U. N. trip. Mr. Holley’s history
classes paid special attention to the
medieval art exhibit. Mr. Dumarae
showed his Latin classes the museum’s
collection of Greek and Roman statuary.

 

Prep Students to Prepare

State Science Fair Display

The Central New Jersey Science Fair,
presented by Rutgers University, will be
held on April 6-7. Exhibits from second-
ary schools are the features of the Fair.
Exhibits may be submitted in any field
of science such as physics, chemistry,
biology and engineering. The winners of
the Regional Science Fair are eligible to
compete in a National Science Fair.

The participants from Rutgers Prep
are Dave Buchine, Franklin Preiser and
Eugene Hohol. They ‘have chosen for
their display a Van De Graaf Generator
as a physics exhibit. The generator is
used to produce high voltage electrical
charges. The exhibit is being prepared
in the science lab of the school under the
supervision of Mr. Francis Calvo. It
is hoped that the exhibit will increase
interest in science.

STUDENT DAY LEADER

Music Lovers Attend
Boheme on April 9

On April 9, 40 music-loving students
of Rutgers Prep will board a bus that
will take them to New York to see a
special performance of Puccini's “La
Boheme.” The opera will be given at
the Metropolitan Opera House and be-
gins at 1 o’clock.

The opera depicts life in 19th century
Paris. It deals mainly with five charac-
ters: Mimi, a beautiful girl, who has
tuberculosis; Rudolph, a writer and the
hero of the story, who shares his attic
apartment with Marcel, the painter;
Coline, the philosopher and Schaunard,
the musician. Mimi goes to Rudolph’s
apartment on Christmas Eve to seek a
light for her candle, and the two fall
in love immediately. Later, the two
are separated, but are finally reunited
before Mimi dies. The story is made
lively by the boisterous fun of the four
friends. The gaiety and picturesque
local color of this opera have given it
undying popularity,

Mr. Dumarae’s present intention is to
give definite instructions concerning the
music, characters and plot to the students
before the group goes to the opera.
He strongly feels that a thorough know-
ledge of the opera will be conducive
to more understanding and better en-
joyment on the part of the audience.
This entire trip was made _ possible
through the efforts of Mr. Dumarae, who
succeeded in enrolling us in the Metro-
politan Opera Guild.

 

 

Faculty-Student Cooperation
Brings Back Prep Tradition

In past years, it has been a privilege
of the students to have a Student Admin-
istration Day. This custom was discon-
tinued last year. However, through the
efforts of John Kuhlthau, President of
the Student Council, and his cabinet,
Student Administration Day will be re-
sumed at Rutgers Prep. With the co-
operation of the faculty and student body,
Student Day will be held on March 30.
On this day, the members of the senior
class will step into the roles of teachers
and administrators.

Teacher-Student Cooperation

Although this day will be of great en-
joyment to the students, and a good time
is almost invariably had, the purpose
of this experiment is more constructive.
Regular plans will be made for the
classes and assignments will be due as
always. The hope that a feeling of co-
operation will prevail and that the stu-
dents will not abuse or be blind to this
opportunity was expressed by ‘both the
Headmaster and the President of the
Student Council.

Seniors Teach Classes

Throughout this entire day, the students
of Prep will have the opportunity to
observe their fellow-students in action
as they take over the classes, The sen-
iors of the school will have the privilege
of teaching one of their classes, and the
positions of the members of the faculty
will be reversed when they assume the
roles of students.

The last Student Administration Day
was held in 1952, and is within the
memory of many Prepsters. In coopera-
tion with Mr, Shepard and the Student
Council, the student body enjoyed a
successful day in which work was accom-
plished and fun was had.

Rutgers University Plans
Romance Languages Day

On Friday, March 26, Rutgers Univer-
sity is sponsoring a Romance Language
Day on its New Brunswick Campus.
This is in answer to a great many re-
quests from the high school teachers of
New Jersey.

This is to be an all-day affair, begin-
ning with lectures and conferences. There
will be a number of plays, given in
French, Spanish, German and _ Italian.

Thanks From ‘The Staff

The Argo staff wishes to thank all those
students whose diligent participation
made the recent magazine drive a suc-
cess. During the past month, this drive
was held in order to earn the money
hecessary to print your newspaper. Stu-
dents sold various magazine publications
to their relatives or by house-to-house
canvassing, and a certain percentage of
the profits was turned over to the school
as part of “The Argo” funds. Thus the
means of continuing further publication
of the paper has been obtained,

Although student enthusiasm for the
project was slow in getting under way,
it soon gained momentum. The team
captains, who volunteered their services,
kept careful track of the proceeds day
by day. Thanks to their excellent man-
agement of the teams, the drive pro-
ceeded with a minimum of confusion.
Due to the many efficient and interested
student salesmen, working with their
captains, “The Argo” now has sufficient
funds to continue regular publication
through May. .
mie atatt of the paper, then, wishes to
thank, most sincerely, those members of
the student body who, by. their coopera-
tion, enthusiasm and assistance, helped
make this drive such a success,

Letters to the Editor

Dear Editor:

I would like to congratulate you on
the fine newspapers that have been put
out this year.

This is the first year that I have
noticed that there is hardly any parking
place for the persons who drive to
school. I believe that something could
‘be done about this.

There is also another matter that
should be taken care of, That is that
the door in Mr, Kallfelz’s room be fixed.

I wonder if it is possible during spring
vacation to have some of the desks in
study ‘hall fixed.

A Friend.

Dear Editor:

The educational trip to New York on
February 27, which was sponsored by Mr.
Gaggini, was a thoroughly enjoyable
event in spite of the fact that we were
exposed to a bit of culture.

Eating at a “tres French” restaurant,
Le Champlain, was an experience of in.
terest to all. The food was of a savory

nature and the cost of it was not ob-
jectionable.

We saw two comedies which were
presented in the French language, and
although some may have found it to
be a good place for insomniaes, the whole
of the group listened quite attentively
to the presentations which were staged
at the Carnegie Recital Hall.

Peter Schwartz

 

Dear Editor:

Well, as usual, I have found some-
thing to gripe about, which is not a
very difficult thing to do.

There is one thing I would like to
know. Is Prep ever going to do any-
thing about that mass of packing crates
and cheesecloth that is commonly and
with grave error called a Stage? The
Prep gym is bad enough, but that
“stage”—UGH! All full of nails, snags,
holes, and weak boards, it isn’t safe to
walk on. And those curtains! Whew!
They are nothing but dust held together
by mould.

Before someone breaks his neck on the
boards or dies of an allergy from the
curtains, can’t something be done?

Grouchy.

John Flanagan is perhaps the most
colorful P. G. that Prep thas had in many
years. Always on hand with a story
of his study hall “adventures” at Tea-
neck High School, or one of his many
unusual experiences of his job at the

A & P, he adds to the gaiety of the
student body.

Throughout his brief stay at Prep
John ‘has maintained a good scholastic
record and always has managed to find
time for student activities. An active
member of the dance committee, his
creative efforts have added to the suc-
cess of the past two dances.

His future plans entail a free cruise
to Bermuda, given by the naval re-
serves and then college. At the present,
the choice is Rutgers, where he plans
to study at the agricultural school. Al-
ready well-known around Prep as a hard
worker, we are sure that John will be
a success in college.

John has already distinguished him-
self at Prep for his outstanding ability
in math, Alwuys ready to help students

often be seen discussing math, his favor-

SPORTLIGHT

By NORMAN KARSHMER

This edition of “Sportlight” will de-
scribe just a few of the athletic feats
of Al Murasko. Al set every conceiv-
able record here at Prep this year. He
wound up as the leader in total points as
well as high game scorer in Middlesex
County.

Murasko pumped 563 markers through
the nets this year for a 296 average.
These are both new Prep basketball
records. Along with these, Al set four
other major records, including the most
field goals in one season, most points in
one game and most points in two consecu-
tive games.

Since baseball and track seasons are
practically here, Prep has fourteen or
more interscholastic baseball games and
seven dual track meets scheduled. Prep
opens the baseball season with a game
against Highland Park High School on
Thursday, April 8, at Highland Park. The
Cindermen open against Newark Acad-
emy on April 28 at Newark.

Congratulations to Don Hughes, who
scored over 250 points in basketball and
to Bill Kurtz and Len Bartlett, who top-
ped the 150 mark and Roger Seamon,
who matched more than 125 tallies.

At this time, “The Argo” sports staff
would like to welcome our new track
coach, Mr. George Moffat, to the Prep
coaching staff. Mr. Moffat participated
in the pole vault at Williams College,
where he vaulted 11’ 10” consistantly.
We all wish Mr. Moffat the best of luck
in the coming season and are sure he
will produce a fine team.

Prediction: Rutgers Prep will have
a 500 or better baseball record this sea-
son.

 

Trackmen Meet For Practice

This year Prep is very fortunate in
having an authentic track coach. Mr.
Moffat, who teaches English on the side,
was formerly a pole vaulter.

Mr. Moffat has had the boys at work
for only one week but the squad is
shaping up quickly.

In the weights, Don Hughes and Cliff
Griggs will take care of the shot put
while Lenny Bartlett is scheduled to
toss the discus.

Joe Hamadyk will play a big part in the
distance runs, and Stu Edelberg shows
great promise in the sprints.

Larry Smith will be kept busy as
he is expected to high jump and also
run in the hurdles.

Mr. Moffat expects a great deal from
Al Murasko, Prep’s great guard of the
past basketball season. As a freshmen
in South River, Al broad jumped 20
feet, so he is expected to really burn up
the cinders.

Baseball Hopefuls
Meet As Drills Begin

The baseball team, under the super-
vision of Coach O’Connell, hopes to start
practice very shortly. Prep’s hopes are
high this year for a better team than
those which have been seen in the last
couple of years. Last year’s team, al-
though it contained several well known
players, did not seem to have the right
spark. This year we all hope that,
with possibly not so many great names,
we will have a better season.

Among the returning players of last
year are Stu Edelberg and Buddy Zajac.
Edelberg will probably land a position
in the outfield, Zajac possibly at second
‘base.

Although we have not seen him play
as of yet, there are high hopes that Al
Murasko, star of Prep’s fiery basketball
team, will be able to add the right kind
of spark to this year’s baseball team.

With all these hopes Prep is al-
ready buzzing with anxiety to begin
practice under the excellent instruction
of Coach O’Connell who expressed the
desire for a baseball season comparable
to our recent one in basketball.

Stars Again

Gn the afternoon of March 6th, the Rut
gers Prep five suffered defeat at the
hands of Pingry School. This was the most
important game of Prep’s entire season,
because the Group III Headmaster’s
Championship rested on it. Being de-
feated by a score of 70-64, Prep has been
beaten two years in succession by al-
most the same Pingry team.

In the scoring department, three play-
ers on the Pingry five, Hert Bush, Chuck
Hite, and Guy Leedom all ran _ into
double figures scoring 28, 20, and 19.
The high scorer for Prep, and for the
entire game, was Al Murasko who, with
a classy selection of sets and driving
Jay-ups, was able to net 31 points and
thus finish up with a stunning season.
Bill Kurtz, on a series of long set shots,
was able to add 18 points to the Little
Scarlet’s score while Don Hughs chip-
ped in with 13 very helpful points in the
bucket.

Prep’s bad break came in the game
when Al Murasko fouled out with 1:55
seconds left in the last quarter. When
Murasko left, the score stood at 63-60,
and almost immediately Pingry’s big
guns, Hite and Busch, ran up six points
in rapid succession, which almost clinch-
ed the game.

Several times during the game the lead
switched hands. The two teams, being
very evenly matched, fought right down
to the wire and at no time, except for
the last two minutes, could anyone tell
who the victor would be. The scoring
by quarters went two to Pingry and two
to Prep.

Murasko closed the season with 563
points credited to him, the most ever
scored by any Prep player.

Prep finished a very successful season
of 15 victories and 4 losses in 19 games.
Three defeats were by Pingry and St.
Marys.

Prep Teacher Heads
State Conference

The second to seventh grades of the
Lower School have been wonderful root-
ers for our basketball team this year.
Their support was greatly appreciated
at Prep.

The teachers of both our Upper and
Lower Schools are extremely interested
in improving their teaching standards.
This is especially true with a favorite,
and much talked about subject, English,
Mr. Heinlein, together with Mr. Moffat
and Mrs. Kehoe, attended a conference
of English teachers in private schools.
At the conference Mrs. Kehoe gave a
talk on the teaching of literature on a
junior level.

Florida is quite appealing to every-
one this time of year, and to those stu-
dents of the Elementary School lucky
enough, it’s not just a dream. On March
4th, Kim and Skip Deitz returned from
Florida and John Shelling left, south-
ward bound.

On March 8th, Tom and Gary Ten
Broeck returned from a month in the
“Sunshine State.”

Little, if anything, has been said this
year about a figure at the Lower School
who has helped so much to make the
student’s education so much more in-
teresting. This person is Mrs. Mildred
Ford, whose expert instruction in the
field of art has broadened the interests
of every student.

The Elementary School chorus, after
a short rest, has begun preparation for
their Spring program under the well
qualified direction of Mrs. Margaret
Kelly.

Many New Groups Formed
For Daily Activities Period

At the beginning of the second semes-
ter, many students formed a number of
new clubs. One of these was the Chess
Club which meets on Wednesday during
activities period. In it are a number
of boys who like to play and are in-
terested in improving their ability at
chess.

Now that work on YE DIAL has been
finished, Mr. Gaggini has reorganized the
Octette, which has lain dormant since
last Spring. The group consists of El-
friede Riddering and Estelle Newman,
sopranos, Clementina Vitti and Diane
Dorn, altos, Stan Bey and Dick Johnson,
tenors, and Malcolm Cohen and Pete
Schwartz, basses. These singers meet
in Room One on Mondays and Fridays
after chapel services to sing madrigals
and other such music as can be sung
by an octette.

News Around Prep

Since our last issue of “The Argo,” a
number of news-worthy events have
taken place. Among the most important
of these: Coach O’Connell finally settled
down. The glorious event took place
on February 20, at one p. m.

The “Queen of Heart’s Dance” had a
poor turnout. Nevertheless, it was a
ball of fun. The theme of the dance
was a brilliant design in red and white.

“What do you think of Senator Mc-
Carthy’s tactics concerning army  of-
ficials?”

Nina Frankel: “I don’t think he is
using the right methods. If he used
more subtle methods he would get
further.”

Patty Lancaster: “I think that Senator
McCarthy’s tactics are unfair, and his
method of investigation should be an
embarrassment to the President of the

The title of queen was won by a pert US

blonde named Elaine Frischley. With
their excellent playing, the “Nocturnes”
did justice to the latest hit tunes. The

highlight of the evening was the tremen-
dous dancing of Estelle Newman and
Teddy Schlasberg. Of course, many of
the other couples had loads of fun try-
ing out various new dances. The high-
point of the evening came when practi-
ally all the couples joined in a “Bunny
Hop.” The “Mexican Hat Dance” also
caused a lot of merriment among the
other couples.
New Course Offered

Prep is now offering a new course
called “Earth Science,” which is being
taught by Mr. O’Connell. The greater
part of the class is made up of fresh-
men, who, judging from their comments,
seem to be quite pleased with it.

An educational conference called
“Secondary Education Board,” proved
to be very beneficial to Prep. Mr. Dum-
arae and Mr. Heinlein attended the
sessions in order to compare our
standards for class achievements with
those of other schools. The result of
this conference was that Prep is
enrolling as a member of this board
for private schools.

On February 27, the French II class,
under the direction of Mr. Gaggini, went
to New York to see two French plays.
Mr. Gaggini and Mr. Dumarae were the
two faculty members in the group and
the others who went were Patty Lan-
easter, Roger Seamon, Peter Schwartz,
Elfriede Riddering, Ginny Riegger, Bill
Muhs and Diane Dorn. The first of
the two plays was “Le Medecin Malgre
Lui” by Moliere. The other was
L’Apollon De Belloc” by Giraudoux. The
entire group had dinner at a French
restaurant called Le Champlain. Ac-
cording to comments, the play was in-
teresting, well-received, and very un-
usual to watch, because of the quaint
scenery. All in all, the trip proved to
be quite exciting.

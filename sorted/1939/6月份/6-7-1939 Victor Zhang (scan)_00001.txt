Mr. Petke Reviews
Baseball Season Of
Satisfactory Merit

 

  

ses Improvement of Infield
Teamwork— Averages Given

In_ reviewing the baseball season,
Couch Walter Petke had nothing but
praise for the improvement that was
shown by the entire team, In the open
ing game, after but one y of real
practice, they w swamped by an only
average Pingry team and gave up many
runs because of the numerous errors,
As the season progressed, both the
pitching staff and the fielding of the
team as a unit improved so that they
were able to close the season with a
shut out against Newman.

The first victory of the team came
when all pre-game predictions were
upset, and the Prep baseball team was
able to down an unusually strong
Newark Academy aggregation. Bent-
\ pitching for Newark, suffered his
first defeat in two years. Jake Bartow
pitched for Prep and was relieved by
Parkinson who received credit for the
victory. Parkinson did an excellent bit

pitched Prep to
tory, allowing only Cwo unearned ©

and not walking a single man. The
other game in which Prep demon-
strated their newly developed power
was the last game in which Ferd Ratti
pitched a shutout against Newman.

Good Infield Work

Although the Prep batting was
never strong, their teamwork in the
infield enabled them to win games. The

infield was composed of Harper at
first base, Manny Werner at second,
Charlie Morfit at short, and Tony
Gwiazdowski at third. Harper, a vet-
eran held over from last year, played
steady and dependable ball right from
the start. The keystone combination
of Werner and Morfit was shaky during
the early part of the season but in
the later games marked improvement
was noticeable, especially in Morfit’s
fielding. At third Tony Gwiz played
in the first few games but hurt his
thumb and was relieved by Ed Kola-
kowski who covered the hot corner
with speed remarkable considering his
size. In the first few games Johnny
Schmidt's catching, usually so depend-
able, was way off his last year’s form.
One of the reasons for this was the
poorly broken-in mitt that he was
using. With constant practice, how-
ever, he was able to round into form
before too many games had gone by.

Kluey Stars in Outfield

In the outfield the most noteworthy
performance was that of John Kluey,
captain of the team. Kluey, an old
veteran in the field and also a relief
pitcher of merit, covered the garden
with ease and assurance, His hitting
was weak at first, but toward the end
of the season he was able to muster
enough hits to raise his batting average
for the season to 227 per cent. Tom
Wenczel showed that he is becoming
quite a dependable man at bat and
ran up a .231 batting average for
himself.

In speaking of Jim Wells, Coach
Petke was generous in his praise. Wells
developed into a fine first baseman and
a steady hitter in the pinches,

The batting average of the team
was .172, Top man was Jim Wells who
had an average of .600, The next man

Vault Record

Rutgers Prep sent two entries to
the New Jersey State Interscholastic
Athletic Association Track and Fleld
Meet, held at Montclair, Saturday,
May 27. These two were Rene Jagen-
burg, who did a brilliant job of pole
vaulting, and Paul Brooke, who ran
in the hundred yard dash.

The most outstanding feature of
the day for Prep was the pole vault-
ing event, in which Jagenburg and
Don Barbieri of Newark Academy
tled for first place. Both vaulters
jumped elev feet six Inches and
thus broke the Group III Prep School
record, which had been ten feet, three-
eighth inches, After trying to vault at
eleven feet nine inches, which both
contestants were unable to do, the
officials of the meet decided to call a
tie, Thus, the honors of breaking the
record were divided between the two
contestants.

In the one hundred yard dash,
Brooke ran a fine race, but the com-
petition was a litle too heavy for

Homecoming Day
Game Ends Season
With Prep Victory

Baseball Nine Defeats Newark
In Best Contest of Year

The principal sporting event of Rut-
gers Preparatory School's annual
Homecoming Day was the baseball
game with Newman School, played on
Neilson Field, June 3. With this being
the last game of the season, the Maroon
and White team brought in another
victory to make a total of four wins in
eleven starts. Although Prep did not
begin the season so well, at the end
they were playing fine ball and de-
feated the boys from Lakewood by a
score of 7-0.

The first two innings of the game
saw Prep go scoreless. However, in the
third inning, the Rutgers Prep boys
got four runs on four hits, The next
inning saw Prep go scoreless again,
but in the fifth, Kluey drove out a
home run which reached the fleld
house on Neilson Field. Also, in this
inning Schmidt was driven In by a
single. In the last inning Morfit scored
another run for Prep, to end the game
with a score of 7-0.

Parents’ Reception
And Luncheon

The second Parents’ Day of the
year was held on Saturday June 3,
at the Boarding School, Luncheon
was served at 1:00 p.m., following
which the guests attended the base-
ball game between Rutgers Pre-
paratory School and Newman
School on the adjacent Netflson
Field.

Assisting Mrs, Stanley Shepard,
Jr., were Mrs. W. B. Cook, Mrs.
H. E, Rudy, and Mrs, M. L. An-
drews. A delicious buffet luncheon
of chicken patties, green peas,
rolls, ice-cream and coffee was
served. The school was happy to
entertain the parents present, and
only regrets that so many must
leave as their boys graduate.

 

 

 

 

Prep’s Baseball
Team Wins Victory

From Bordentown

 

Parkinson Pitches Good Game.
Testeri Stars For Losers

Although Perrapoto of Bordentown
hit a circuit clout in the first inning
of the game on May 31, Prep rallied
to defeat the Military Institute team
by a score of 6-2. Behind the beautiful
pitching of Fred Parkinson, who did
not walk a single man, the boys of the
Rutgers Preparatory team played one
of the nicest games of their season,

In the first inning Prep did no scor-
ing at all, while Bordentown chalked
up the first tally of the game with a
home run. With Bordentown bringing
in another run in their half of the
second inning, it looked bad for Prep.
However, Prep scored their first run
in the third inning. In this inning
Testeri, playing shortstop for Borden-
town, made a stop which deserves much
praise. Tom Wenczel, of Prep, hit a
red hot grounder, and Testeri, turning
around and bending down in an al-
most impossible position, stopped the
ball and threw Wenezel out. A play
of this type is usually seen only in the
major leagues.

After scoring the run in the third
inning, Prep remained behind until
the sixth, by a score of 2-1, In the
sixth inning, Prep pushed another run
across the plate to tle the score, 2-2.
The good old lucky seventh brought in
four more runs for Prep, giving them
the ball game. Bordentown, in their
were held score-

 

 

half of the seventh,
less.

Dr. Potter To
Deliver Address

Seven Seniors Are Elected
To Cum Laude

 

The 173rd Commencement of the
Rutgers Preparatory School will be
held in Kirkpatrick Chapel, Rutgers
University, on Thursday, June 15.
These exercises mark the close of @
very successful year at the school,
and the number of Seniors graduating
exceeds that of many previous years.
The services are scheduled to begin
at eleven o’clock and will be fol-
lowed by a buffet luncheon served on
the lawn of the boarding school. All
parents and boys of the school are
cordially invited to attend.

Program for Exercises

The program for the commence-
ment exercises will be opened by an
organ prelude, played by Mrs. Willard
Chandler Thompson, mother of W
C. Thompson ‘4. Dean Fraser Metz-
ger, D.D. will then deliver the In-

Yooutio|
Mon at itutgers University and a.

miliar figure and {riend to all Prep
school boys. The congregation will
sing the well-known Crusader’s Hymn
which has long been a favorite at
the school. The seven Seniors who
have been elected to Cum Laude will
then be presented and admitted into
the order, following which the vari-
ous prizes for achievement through-
out the school will be awarded.

Rutgers Prep has been exceedingly
fortunate in procuring for the Bac-
calureate address Dr. F. Marmaduke
Potter, Secretary of Foreign Mis-
sions of the Dutch Reformed Church,
and father of Allen Potter of the
graduating class. Dr. Potter is a mem-
ber of the Preparatory School Coun-
cil, a graduate of Rutgers Univer-
sity, and was the first Rhodes Scholar
ever to be chosen from that institu-
tion. He was for a time instructor
of Latin at the Prep School, on his
return from Oxford. He has just re-
turned from a sojourn In India.

Following this address, Mr. Stan-
ley Shepard, Jr., Headmaster of the
school, will make the presentation
of diplomas to the graduating class,
according to his usual custom. The
exercises will conclude with the sing-
ing of the hymn, “God of Our
Fathers,” and the Benediction, to be
pronounced by Dean Metzger.

Cum Laude Elections

The chapter of Cum Laude of the
Rutgers Preparatory School is pleased
to announce the election of the fol-
lowing members: Arnold, J., Schmidt,
J., Kellogg, V., Wells, J., Clark, W.,
Feldman, L., and Mohr, H. Announce-
ment of these elections, which repre-
sent the highest seventh of the grad-
uating class, was made at the close
of recess on Tuesday, June 6. The
ceremony was conducted by Mr, Shep-
ard, and an address was delivered by
Dr, Willlam Henry ie Demarest.
Dr. Demarest was President of Rut-
gers University for the long term of
twenty-five years. He was also Presl-
dent of the New Brunswick Theo-
logical Seminary, and is at present
the Chairman of the Mayor's Commit-
tee for Public Welfare In New Bruns-

APOLOGIA

When this issue of THE ARGO goes to press, we, the editorial
staff, will have made our final contribution to Rutgers Prep as
undergraduates and will progress to a new Alma Mater. It is our
hope that we have been successful in our efforts of elevating THE
AkGO to the position that it has held in previous years and have
left it a tradition that will be carried on in years to come.

A school paper is valuable to a school and its students in many
ways. As stated in our tirst editorial, a paper’s first duty is to report
all of the activities of the school in order to promote school spirit.
Another objective of a school paper that few students realize is the
fact that it is the face of the school. Many other schools receive
copies otf THE ARGO, and their opinion ot our school is based largely
on the activities as reported by ‘(HE ARGO. This is important be-
cause many of the schools with which we exchange papers are too

far distant to meet teams in competition or to visit the campus,
and their lone contact with Prep is through THE ARGO. The last
point of value is not what the student body and school receive from
the paper but the experience that those boys that work on it re-
ceive. The field of journalism is a fine one, and early experience is a
valuable asset.

We who have worked on THE ARGO hope that the school has
benefited by our work and that we have made some contribution to
the success of this school year.

PURPOSES

This seems an appropriate time of the year for us to reflect upon
our reasons for attending school. In line with this we decided to get
the ideas of the masters on their purpose in teaching. We found
them most interested and helpful.

Mr. Cook stated that his purpose in teaching was to train his
students to think clearly and logically, even under adverse condi-
tions, to develop their memory, and to learn to concentrate.

Mr. Brewer, in teaching English, has tried to introduce boys to
certain types of literature which compare very favorably in interest
with the current pictorial magazines. He has also attempted to teach
grammar in such a way that good English speech will seem natural,
not affected.

In presenting the sciences, Mr. Rudy has tried to prepare his stu-

dents for college—especially the first year of college, which is un-
questionably the most difficult—so that they will be successful
academically.

Mr. Holley’s objective is to infuse his interest in the subject of
History into his pupils. He teaches for the satisfaction it gives him
to work with boys in a field in which he is so much interested.

In teaching the Freshman courses in English and Algebra, Mr.
McClintock has attempted to give his students a solid foundation in
these subjects so that they may benefit from advanced instruction
later on. .

Mr. Stearns’ purpose with Latin has been acquaint boys in his
classes with the thought of the earlier days of civilization, and to
show them a language more logical and precise than English.

We were unable to interview Mr. Petke on the subject, but we
would like to mention his attitude on coaching sports. His purpose
is to build up self-confidence in the boys on his teams, rather than
try for an undefeated season, desirable as this may be.

In teaching Romance languages, Mr. Ralls endeavors to broaden
the student’s basis of culture by giving him a cosmopolitan point of
view through leading him away from provincialism.

These views show the sincere interest and sympathy which our
masters have for their classes. While they represent a wide variety

of opinions, nevertheless they indicate real thought on the subject,

and a desire to benefit their students by all means within their
power.

 

 

PICK-UPS

By Vincent Kellogg

 

 

 

One of the latest reports of the Car-
negle Foundation concerns College...
so it should be of interest to most of
us.., A searching exam was given to
many students all over the U.S. and
these are some of the surprising though
suspected things that w found...
In one typical college, graduating about
two hundred seniors, all of whom had
completed the same course of study, it
was found that if graduation depended
upon knowledge acquired instead of on
time served, three-quarters would not
have received sheepskins . . . Instead
289% would have been juniors, 23%
sophomores and 249% freshmen . . -
Another choice bit was the difference
between “high” and “low” colleges
... Not one of the students of the
“low” colleges reaches the intellectual
level of the most stupid sophomore of
the “high” college . . . For more of
the same see the June 10th issue of
Liberty...

. . .

Herbert Hoover claims that he has
found that most anglers are “optimis-
tic and also Republicans” A rare
combination to say the least... And
then again with all their spare time

  

   

      

 
 

  

 

. why not?
. * *
Despite all of Grover's publicity, New
York still likes the beach, roller-

coasters and hot dogs of Coney Island
. .. Last Sunday three hundred thou-
sand people saw the preview of the
World of Tomorrow ... But five hun-
dred thousand were willing to remain
with the world of today and stuck to
the time tried pleasures of Coney Is-
land .. . Five cent instead of two bit
C. I. chicken...

* * .

To Mexicans we of the U.S. have al-
ways been “Gringos” .. . It seems that
this goes back to the Mexican War...
At that time the official march of the
American Army was “Green grow the
Rushes” . . . And so came about prob-
ably the first Mexican pun .. .

* . .

In every great pageant there always
appears some pathetic note... In the
recently opened Czecho-Slovakian pa-
vilion at the World’s Fair the flag is
always displayed at half mast and a
mural proclaims “Begun by the Repub-
lic of Czecho-Slovakia. Though unfin-
ished, maintained by her friends in
America.”

* . .

To the city of Chicago was left a
very tidy sum to build a drinking
trough “for man and beast”... A con-
test of the will held up construction
tor forty-five years, but at last work
is under way, and the super-sumptuous
fount will be erected near the shores
of Lake Michigan ... At least “man”
has been able to survive to benefit...

. .

One of the most recent additions to
the comfort of the soda suckers is the
“Sparkoffee Soda” introduced at Bam-
berger’s . , . It’s a takeoff on the Kat-
fee Hag or Sanka idea of “de-caffeined”
coffee . . . Advised for those indulgers
who are afraid their sodas might
cause insomina... or “jangled nerves,”

. . °

There is a Princeton senior who up
until last week had not missed a single
fire... Faithfully with the sound of
the siren he was off... but an English
exam caused the end of his record,—
something that the elements of nature
were unable to do...

. . »

Albert Cooper, the driver of the
truck that hit the limousine in which
Queen Mary was riding, set a prece-
dent for all future accidents of this
kind and put to shame the American
truck dri . . He sent flowers to
the Queen . . . And what's more the
Queen dispatched a very polite note of
thanks: . Instead we have withering
epithets, coarse demands of “who's
sonna pay,” lawsuits and a determ
tion that the next time we'll really
show ‘em... Some fun.

Don’t quote me on this statement,

fact that their girls are one girl. Quite

That bunch of sociable-minded fel-
lows who gave tea parties in their

effect of the suppression of the two.

know what to do with himself if he

well, there’s consolation in the fact
that he won't have to do much worry-

Could it be true that the customs of
ye olde days are returning? One never
can tell, but evidence points toward
the regeneration of old customs former-
ly participated in by the by-gone gentle-
men of yesteryear. I speak of the hon-
orable way of setting gentlemen's dis-
putes—by duelling. [t seems that re-
cently, in a college of the south, two
young men became infatuated over the
same girl. Formally slapping each
others respective cheeks, the two de-
clared that they would duel at down,
with swords, of course. The flaming sun
rose high into the sky the next morn-
ing, but no clash of swords echoed in
the corridors of the college gym. The
reason—well, one student’s bag was
sone—and a ladder was found under
the window of the disputed one. Put-
tng two and two together, the remain-
ing student decided that with the
strain off his pocketbook he'd be able
to make a play for the blond on the
other campus.

Tennis Squad Wins
Pennington Match

Are Downed by Bordentown

After losing the first set of the
deciding match against Pennington
on Saturday, May 27, Freeman Mac-
Kay and Vincent Kellogg rallied to
pull victory out of the fire and there-
by give Prep a three to two triumph.
MacKay had previously won _ his
singles by the score of 7-5, 6-4 to gain
the honor of being the only double
winner of the afternoon.

Prep’s other win was scored by
Jack Coad who has made great strides
as a tennis player this spring and is
now firmly implanted as number
three man, He won a hard fought
match in three sets but never lost
control of the play.

The most thrilling match of the
afternoon was the number one
doubles on which hung the outcome
of the contest. MacKay and Kellogg
won this match 4-6, 8-6, 6-4. They
lost the first set, largely due to the
numerous double faults that Kellogg
was making. In the long second set
Kellogg’s service steadied down, and
MacKay became more aggressive, en-
abling them to come from behind and
finally win this crucial set. In the
set that followed they kept up the
pace and came through to remain un-
defeated in all matches played to
date,

BAM. Wins 4-1

MacKay saved Prep from being
whitewashed when he won their only
match of the day on Wednesday, May
31. It was a sweltering day, and the
cadets had too much all-round tennis
power for Prep.

Burkley and Styler defeated George
Styskal and Jack Coad respectively In
the singles, and then Prep's number

Werner Makes Prep’s Point
In Close Game

Bud Mains won his own ball game
as he pitched and batted Morristown
echvol to a 2-1 victory over Prep at
Morristown’s home field. Striking out
ten men, he allowed few walks, and
Werner was able to score only by
stealing bases. This was Prep’s sixth
defeat in eight starts, while it was
Morristown's fourth win in eleven
starts,

Prep scored first in the fifth in-
ning when Werner walked, with two
men on base, and stole second and
third. The next pitch by Mains was
wild, and Werner went home to score
the first and only run for his team.
Morristown evened the score in its
half of the same inning, as Dabney
walked and scored on White's triple
base hit with one man out. White,
however, was stranded as Lippett
nied out, and Mains grounded out.

In the seventh inning Ballentine
singled, was rificed to second by
Dabney, and scored the decisive run
on Main’s double. Mains allowed Prep
only two hits,

Prep Bows Before
Lawrenceville, 7-2

Ratti Shows Up Well In First
Full Game

Prep lost its fifth game in seven
starts to Lawrenceville on May 17, at
Lawrenceville’s own diamond. It was
Ferd Ratti’s first full game on the
mound and he pitched excellently
throughout the seven innings. Ratti
struck out eleven men and allowed
his opponents only four hits. Corby,
of Lawrenceville, also did his share
on the mound for his own team, by
striking out seven men and allowing
Prep only five hits.

After quite a pitchers’ duel in the
first inning, the Red and Black team
scored two runs to put them in the
lead. However, Prep soon tightened
up, and it was not until the sixth in-
ning that Lawrenceville scored again,
In the meantime Prep scored two
runs in the fifth frame, to tie the
score. In the sixth inning Lawrence-
ville went on a spree and put five
runs across the plate, making their
team ahead seven to two, In the first
half of the seventh, Prep made a
desperate effort to score a few runs,
but the Lawrenceville team was play-
ing heads up ball, so in a short time
the game ended with the Laurentians
ahead, 7-2.

Montclair Again, 8-7

Close Return Game Fails To
Balance First Defeat

In a return game, Prep lost for the
second time to Montclair Academy at
the Montclair Athletic Club, by a
score of 8-7. Jake Bartow started in
the pitcher's box for Prep, and
pitched well, but he got into difficul-
ties in the sixth inning and was re-
lieved by Fred Parkinson. Dwyer
went the limit as pitcher for Mont-
clair.

Prep scored one run in the second
inning and one in the third, to lead,
2-0. However, Montclair came back
In the fourth to tle the score, 2-2.
Prep went scoreless through half of
the fifth inning, while the rival team
scored three runs, In the sixth in-
ning Prep added another run, and
the Blue and Red team went score-
less in their half.

As the last inning arrived, it looked
black for Prep, but the New Bruns-
wick boys went on a spree to score
tour runs, making the score 7-6 in
Prep's favor. But the Montclair ag-
gregation had not lost yet, and in
their half of the old lucky seventh,
they scored two runs to win the
game at last.

Prep Tennis Team
Defeats South River, 4-1

Loses to Montclair and Hun

Freeman MacKay led the Rutgers
Prep tennis squad to its first victory
of the season on Friday, May 18, by
winning in both the doubles and
singles. Jack Coad also breezed
through two matches to be another
double winner.

In the number one singles match
MacKay defeated Moluski in three
sets. His second victory came when
he and Vincent Kellogg won their
doubles in a match which was of
litle importance because Prep already
led three to one. After losing the first
set 6-4 and having the score five to
one against them in the second, Mac-
me os Kellogg rallied to win 4-6
7-5, 6-2.

Coad, playing his first singles match
of the year, had little difficulty in
defeating Parr 6-2, 6-2. Coad then
teamed with George Styskal and won
again in straight sets.

The only South River victory was
that of Alexander over Farley 6-0,

Montclair Takes Team's Measure

A well balanced Montclair tennis
team won all of the singles and lost
only one of the doubles matches to
down Prep 4-1 on Saturday, May 20.
The lone Prep victory came when
Freeman MacKay and Vincent Kel-
logg won their number one doubles
and thereby remained in the unde-
feated column.

MacKay lost his first singles match
of the year long three-set match,

The heart breaking match to lose
was the number three singles when
Jack Coaa lost to George. Coad won
the first set, 6-2, and then made a
strong bid tor victory in the second
but finally lost it 7-5. The third set
was won by George 6-2

The other Hun victories were

It seemed highly possible that they
might still win the match, as both
sides held service up to five all. They
suddenly collapsed, however, d lost
the next two games for an unexpected
deteat. MacKay defeated Engle in the

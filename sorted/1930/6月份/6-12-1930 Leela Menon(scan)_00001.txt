[ELEMENTARY NOTES _| ELEMENTARY NOTES

Bob McKiernan of the first grade
jentertained all his class at a party
jon his seventh birthday. Games
were played and refreshments
were served.

The fourth grade entertained at
the last meeting of the Arts Club
with three dramatizations: “The
Hare and the Tortoise,” Billy Alns-
lee and Kenneth Arnulfo; “The
Town Mouse and the Country
Mouse,” Mary Skeels and Alice
Dunn: “The Miraculous Pitcher,”
Paul, Billy Wilmot, Bill Bryan, and
Alice.

The eighth grade has elected the
Toney ne officers: President, Lane

Brown; vice president, Catharine
Loughran; secretary, John Miller.

Many children were made happy

by being given Eastman  kodaks.
They had their pictures taken with
thelr new cameras,
There will be no more class
meetings in the third grade this
year, The object of this organiza-
tion has been to -make this grade
the best one possible. During the
year the presidents, Alfred Bros-
sard, Joachim Kopp, and Pat Hoff-
man have served well and have
learned something about parliamen-
tary law. The minutes were well
written by the secretaries, Chand-
ler Thompson, Geraldine Van Ma-
ter, and Thurlow Nelson, The en-
tertainment committee, of which
Pat Hoffman, Teddy Snyder, and
Dwight Stauffer were chairmen,
offered some good programs and
made the last half hour each Fri-
day a very pleasant affair. James
Loughran played some good tunes
on his harmonica.

Mary Dorothy of the second
grade gave a Cinderella party on
Tuesday, May 13. The invitations
were silver slippers, and all the
girls of the second grade were in-
vited.

Elizabeth Kinsport spent a week-
end at Sea G re

The R. EY baseball team play-

I woke with quite a jar.

My master took me from the shelf
And threw me in the car,

And then—oh, what a view.

If you would care to hear me talk
I'll tell my tale to you.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Question: What
the delinquent D?
Beit known that-tnthe April-of
the year 1930, the D key of the
typewriter habitually used by the
members of The Argo staff, assum-
ing a belligerent and aggressive at-
titude, refused to function. The
occasion for this is not clearly un-
derstood, but it is suspected that
a member of the staff, becoming
enraged over a trifile, wrote in ma-
lictous anger his favorite cuss word
begining with D, with such merci-
less force that the key was there-
by put out of operation. Neither
is it clearly understood how it hap-
pens that that very same D key is
now In operation and functioning

roperly. But it is rumored that
Shive, and Wycoff, internationally
known typewriter mechanics, had

hand in setting it aright, for
these two were the only occupants
of the editorial room on the day
that the correction took place.
However that be, it is hoped that
whoever was respofisible for the
defiance of the delinquent D will
hereafter refrain from using an
honorable and upright typewriter
for such low purposes as writing
cuss words, or at least will refrain
from wriitng that or those begin-
ning with @

7 p. m., and was brought to a close
at about $:15 p. m., after which the
members of the club had town per-
mission until 11:30,

Mr. Alvin Van Hoff presided over
the banquet and, after the meal
had been served, he introduced the
first speaker, Mr, Kelly, the head-
master, who told how much he had
enjoyed having a glee club in Rut-
gers Prep, and told of a few ex-
periences he had when he was in
a glee club. Mr, Kelly also stated
that the glee club is not the very
first one that Prep has had, but

Next, the president surprised the
club by calling on the director of
the club, Mr. Edmund M. McClos-

expressed his appreciation at hav-
ing a club such as the group he
controlled this year, and his de-

Leonard Gets 95.75 Mark

 

The honor roll for April shows a
total of 33. Arthur Leonard, un-
seating Capano, leads the senior
class with the excellent average of
95.75. Greene and Nebel still lead
the juniors and sophomores, re-
spectively, while Vauchez now leads
the freshman class. In spite of the
that some show discouraging
and that others went off the
honor list completely, nevertheless,
a few made very good increases,
and there are one or two additions
to the roll.

Lawyers’ Association, |
Strong Stirs Audience

As the first speaker for the nega-
tive, Mr. Strong pointed to the pre-
prohibition conditions as proving
the impossibility of state control,
showed that 10 question of the le-
gallty of the question had ever
been raised in the Supreme Court,
and that the majority of Americans
favored the amendment, if not the
Volstead Act, He further stated that
the repeal was very unlikely as
the drys held the majority in con-
gress, and could certainly muster
13 states in favor of the amend-
ment in case of an attempted re-
peal,

Jones, the second man on the af-
firmative tea‘n, spoke next, show-
ing that in 1918 the people of the
United States did not want prohi-
bition, and that now, they are
greatly opposed to it, as was shown
by the 1920 census and various
referenda on the question, He
further quoted Senator Harris of
Georgia, an ardent dry, as saying
that the bootlegger is now fifty
times worse than the bar-room was,

Economie Grounds Considered

He also opposed the amendment
on economic grounds, as costing
the American people a billion dol-
lars a year Cirectly and indirectly,
and quoted figures to show that the
alcoholic death rate for the coun-
try has inereased nearly 2 per cent
per hundred thousand since prohi-
bition.

Suter next spoke as the second
man for the negative, say!
the law was as great a success as
could reasonably be expected, re-
ferring to (ip greatfailure to en-
force the lay in regard to murder,
Suter emphasised the fact that the
affirmative could offer no construc-

tive vefornmgor substitute for the
amendmen!
Allen, the last speaker on the

affirmative, dwelt upon the higher
death rate of the country com-
pared to that of Englund or Can-
ada, due to the larger per cent of
polsoned alcohol in the Hquor, He
showed that the enforcement offi-
cers were criminals, and that con-
sressmen themselves flouted the
law. He spoke of the large number
of killings and the greater amount
of drunkenness in‘ the country as
compared with that in the other
countries, Allen at the end of his
speech summarized those of hiv

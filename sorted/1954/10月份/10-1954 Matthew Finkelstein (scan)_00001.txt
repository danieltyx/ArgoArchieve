Barbecue Dance
Proves Success

On September 25, an outdoor bar-
becue and dance was held at the Rut-
gers Prep School gym. There was a
large turnout as was anticipated..

The committee for the dance was
headed by Clemmie Vitti. Other mem-
bers were: Clifford Griggs, Estelle New-
man, Carl Baratta, Nancy Haworth,
Dave Hendler, Joe Messina, and Stuart
Edelberg.

Estelle Newman donated a loud
speaker for the music. Stuart Edelberg
and Dave Hendler donated the barbe-
cue pits. The records used were those
of many students.

Mr. Holley led the group in a num-
ber of amusing games and immediately
following these games, there was an
announcement of the results of the
election for the Student Council. The
remaining part of the evening was spent
in dancing.

Class Election Held
For Representatives

by Moreen Hudson

During the third week of school each
class elected its representatives to the
Student Council.

The eighth grade elected: John Roze;
the freshmen: Arthur Karshmer; the
sophomores: Joe Messina and Victor
Stilwell; the juniors: Howard Tobin;
and the seniors: Gerry Gorczyca and
Bob Shorosky.

The seniors favored post graduates
as leaders of their class. Gerry Gorczy-
ca and Bob Shorosky, doubtless, will
give their full support to the Council.

The juniors favored Howard Tobin.
Howard who is now in his fourth year
at Prep should be able to handle his
job competently.

Joe Messina and Victor Stilwell, both
very good students academically and
otherwise, will more than fill their
positions as representatives.

Arthur Karshmer, a member of the
school last year, will undoubtedly do his
share of work for the Council.

PLATFORM PROMISES
by Dave Hendler

The political campaign is over and
the officers to the Student Council
have been selected. After the dust of
the campaign had settled, the students
asked such questions as, “Will the
campaign promises be carried out?”

This year, in our student election, the
two parties had as different a cam-
paign platform as any one may have.
The Diplomatic party aimed its cam-
paign at the school.

The Diplomats offered among other
things new flag poles and a hot water

letter winners and uniforms for the
cheerleaders.

Prepsters Plan Activities

The other party, the Prepsters, set
up their platform with the idea of
more and better student activities. The
Prepsters plan to have a trip to an
opera, two formal dances, and an in-
formal dance every month and also a
“Senior Day”. A portion of the plat-
form was devoted to the underclass-
men to insure a wonderful time for
them at Prep.

As of now three of the plans have
been carried out by the Student Coun-
cil. They are the Prepsters’ Jamboree,
which was the first of these promises,
transportation to the games and a

 

Hayride.

   

system. They also planned to supply }

Edelberg Beats Bey
For Top Position...

From one of the fieriest Student
Council election campaigns ever to be
held at Rutgers Prep emerged a combi-

nation group of Prepster and Diplo-
matic candidates.

The Prepsters’ president nominee, Stu
Edelberg, and the Diplomatic nominee,
Stan Bey, fought tooth and nail to a
close decision, with Stu Edelberg the
victor. The Diplomat, Rog Seamon, de-
feated opposing candidate Cliff Griggs
for the vice-presidency, but Clemmie
Vitti of the Prepsters was voted in as
secretary, in spite of Marian Veale’s
vigorous race for it. The Council board
was completed by the election of Stan
Rosenblum of the Diplomats who de-
feated Joe Messina ina close contest.
Carl Baratta and Dave Handler were
managers for the Prepster party and
Pete Schwartz for the Diplomats.

Interviewed after the election results
,were announced, Stu Edelberg, winner
of the presidency, said, “I would like
to thank the student body for electing
me and my only hope is for the strong-

est and most active Student Council
possible.”

Loser Urges Support

| Stan Bey, losing candidate, graceful-
|ly accepted defeat by stating, “I am
sorry that I did lose, but I do hope that
|the student body will give the Student
Council its 100% support. I would like
to thank those who did vote for me.”

Both parties presented their platform
on Wednesday and Thursday preceed-
ing the elections.

The Prepsters advocated closer teach-
er student relations, more dances, bet-
ter transportation facilities to and
from sports events, and other minor
changes.

The Diplomats motto, “government
for the students and by the students.”
had top billing, with further promises
including new uniforms for the cheer-
leaders, jackets for the varsity players,
and added hot water facilities. Promises
of possible outings and excursions were

 

made by both parties.

Dear Editor,

necessity!”

I hope you will answer my plea by

some new apparel so that they will not

only be nice but look nice, too. - -
Hopeful.

Dear Editor,

In the beginning of the year one of
the candidates stated in his speech
that senior advisors would be of benefit
to new students and eighth graders.

I, as a new student, feel this would

be most helpful. The first day I at-
tended Rutgers Prep, I was slightly

 

congratulations to the entire student
body for the fine school spirit which
it has shown in the first few weeks of
school.

As you remember, the editorial of
the Argo’s first edition dealt with the
poor school spirit of Prep which was
prevalent in previous years. However,
the tide seems to have changed and
Prep once more stands out with Public
schools in school spirit.

The barbecue dance which was held
two weeks after the opening of school
was a tremendous success. Attendance
at soccer games is at an all time high,
and our only hope is that this athletic
enthusiasm will continue through the
basketball and baseball season.

We were pleased to see how the Stu-
dent Council was pressed to run another

social activity at the end of October. |

A hayride will probably be the event
run by the Student Council by popular
demand.

The Student Council has offered to
run as many social events as the stu-
dents themselves will back. As we look
at the situation now there will be two
proms, and in addition informal events
run every month. There will also be
two bus trips, one to the opera and
the other will be to one of the museums.

Another matter which has long
troubled the student body at Prep is
being taken care of by this year’s coun-
cil. This is the matter of social events
which lower classmen can also enjoy.
The '54-55 school should prove a suc-
cess to all.

bewildered because I had trouble find-
ing my classes.

The senior advisors could also help
teach the new students the rules of the
school and introduce them to the upper
elassmen. This would help them to get
to know their school and fellow stu-
dents.

A New Student.

 

Prep Plans Hayride

At the Student Council meeting, the
foremost discussion on the floor dealt
with some sort of social event. The
night on which the event is to be held
will be the 30th of October.

After some debate, the council de-
‘cided on having a Hayride. When dis-
‘cussed, it seemed to be both fun and
economical. Mr. Heinlein agreed to its
possibilities.

Several trucks or wagons will be the
means of transportation. The distance
and route of the ride have not been
decided on as of yet.

This affair is open to all students
and their dates. “As usual,” the Stu-
dent Council says, “the cooperation of
all the students will be necessary to
make it a great success.”

The Hayride is a new experience for
Prep. For many years, a Hayride was
promised to the students, but it always
fell through. This year, however, it

 

is a reality.

MOVIE REVigw

by Roger Seamon

Herman Wouk's current nove}
“Caine Mutiny”, has been put into
third medium and with a great its
of success. As a film, much a
original content of the book js cmnit
but the remainder has been mies
into a powerful story of life on ed
the D. M. S. Caine which climay,
modern sea saga. The movie fg
Humphrey Bogart as the paranoiac oq,
tain of the Caine. The ensuing cian
between Queeg and his officers aa
the basis for the court martial of
Marek, who was portrayed by ic
Johnson.

The typhoon, during which Marek
assumes command, is one of the
exciting scenes on the screen in a long
while.

The “Caine Mutiny” is filmed in Tech
nicolor and I recommend it to anyone
who enjoys a movie containing laughter
and romance.

Limelight

This issue of the ARGO has chosen
to “Limelite” one of the most popular
and well liked seniors in the school,
Clifford Griggs. Clifford is in his fourth
year at Prep, has a good sports record
and an even better scholastic one.

In spite of the fact that Cliff was
not elected to the student council this
year, he still has a lot of interest in
school activities. He is a member of
the soccer team and will also be on the
baseball and track squads. Cliff has
been a member of the “Varsity R Club”
for two years and was a representative
on the Student Council in his junior
year. He also was on the Jamboree
‘and Hayride committees and will con-
tribute his efforts to any further activ-
ities at Prep.

Cliff’s specialty is that he is one of
the better students in both Algebra III
and Trig. These will aid him in be-
coming an engineer, which is his am-
bition. He would like to go to Rutgers
oo and we wish him the best of
uck.

the best team in basketball that the
asad nas ever seen. This column of
i. «gportlight” will try to name some
of the players that are expected to do
<g much for the Prepsters this year.
. First of all we have Roger Seamon.
Rog did a great job last year for Prep
at his guard position and will surely
prove to be @ great help this year.
another man who returned to us from
jast year is Chuck Martorelli. Chuck
was a varsity man and has improved
to the point where he can be a real
spark plug.

A great deal of good players from out-
side Prep are with us this year. This
new lot of players is studded by such
names as Gerry Gorezyca, Bob Sho-
rosky and Dave Whalen. Gerry was a
pig help to St. Mary's of South Amboy
last year and a big thorn in the side
of Prep. In three years of high school
pall, he reached 800 points.

 

Bob Shorosky comes to us from Say-
reville where he did a colossal job. He
scored very well and Coach O'Connell
is looking forward to having him on
the team. Dave Whalen came this year
to Prep from St. Peters. He, too, should
prove to be a great asset to the team.

Last but not least we must not forget
Roger Lambertson. Rog also played for
Hoffman High where he did a great
job at his forward position. Coach
O'Connell said that he may be small
but he is a little ball of fire.

I would like to comment at this
time about the record of our soccer
team. Up to new, have not won a game
but the team is getting better. James-
burg, here we come!

SPORTS FLASH

The Prepsters’ Soccer team received
its third defeat of the season from
Linden High School. The final score
was 2-1.

Linden scored in the first period to
take an early lead. Then in the second
period, Stu Edelberg tied the score for
his second goal of the season. The
assist on the goal went to Stan Rosen-
blum. The second period was sparked
by a brilliant defensive play on the
part of Cliff Griggs. Gerry Gorczyca,
Prep’s goalie, was pulled out of the goal
and the ball was kicked in front of
the open goal. Cliff Griggs, Prep’s full-
back, literally sat on the ball prevent-
ing it from being kicked into the goal
until Gerry could pick up the ball.

However, Linden scored in the third
period to win the game.

SOCCER REVIEW

by Joe Messina

Although our soccer team lost its
first game, I feel it should show much
improvement throughout the season.
No one can deny that the team has
good material. It is just a question of
| how soon it will begin to click.

Our forward wall led by Stu Edel-
berg, is a great threat to other teams.
Roger Lambertson, who never played
soccer before in his life, played a great
game and is a great asset to the team.
With a few fine wings, a line can soon
start to go.

Our half-backs, led by Stan Rosen-
blum, are playing a good game. The
team’s defense is gradually shaping up,
with Cliff Griggs and Bert Sathmary
playing full-back and Gerry Gorczyca
protecting our goal. Looking ahead to
future games, there is no question that
Prep has a tough schedule. Peddie
should have a very good team, but ours
should be at its very best when we
play them. After Pingry it’s Jamesburg,
a team we'd like to beat.

After our Pingry game, the team felt
very confident. Although we lost, we
made a very impressive showing and
we can expect to do a lot better. We
have the best team on the field right
now in three years. I am sure you will
be proud of the team.. Come out and
cheer them on to victory.

Pingry Defeats Prep 3-0
In Opening Soccer Game

Last week, Rutgers Prep opened its
third year of soccer with a loss to a
tough Pingry eleven. It was hard fought
by both teams, but Pingry capitalized
on a few breaks while Prep failed to
take advantage.

Pingry scored their first goal mid-
way through the first period when
Hooker headed a centering kick over
the head of Jerry Gorezyca. The rest of
the period was scoreless, but both teams
played hard all the way.

After changing goals for the second
period, Pingry scored again. This was
a beautiful play which caught two
Prep fullbacks on the same side of the
goal. After a slight cross, McCowell
booted Pingry’s second goal.

The third period saw no scoring but
a lot of excitement. Prep had some
beautiful chances to score but failed to
capitalize.

Hooker of Pingry scored again in
the beginning of the fourth period.
After this, Pingry played a defensive
game, stopping many Prep threats.

Although Prep lost many players
played a great game. Stu Edelberg, as
usual, played a good game. Gerry Gor-
czyca, also, on his first attempt at
goalie did very well. Stan Rosenblum

 

and Cliff Griggs also played well.

We, too, must give a lot of credit to
the superb Pingry team. Their full-
backs were tremendous, not letting the
Prep line get anywhere near the goal.
Their halfbacks, also, were great getting
the ball down to an equally superb
line.

Prep has many more games left, in-
cluding one more with Pingry, one with
Linden, one with Peddie and two each
with Jamesburg and Wardlaw.

Cheerleaders Hold Tryouts
by Barbara Lipman

Rutgers Prep has now officially open-
ed its 1954-55 season of sports. To back
up the team with their color, pep, and
enthusiasm are the cheerleaders. They
add a lot to the school spirit. Whether
winning or losing, they keep up the
the vigor and morale of the fans.

Ten girls tried out for cheerleading,
including three from last year.. Eight
out of these were chosen. Noreen Hud-
son, one of last year’s cheerleaders, was
picked as this year's head cheerleader.
Nancy Haworth, and Clemmie Vitti are
the other two from the 1953-54 squad.
The new-comers, Gail Duschock, Marian
Thompson, Sharon Reis, Pat Rose and
Barbara Lipman are all pleased with
their new adventure.

Dressed alike, in maroon skirts and
white sweaters, they perform in unison.
Many long hours of practicing the
cheers have been necessary to work as
a co-ordinated team.

about it.”

Gerry Gorezyca— “I'd bring them
to a shoemaker and have them repair-

Vic Stilwell— “I'd try them on for

John Perduk— “I'd throw them out.”

Martin Bertman— “I'd give them to
Mr. O'Connell for the soccer team.”

New Seniors Supply Spark
by Howard Tobin

Dave Whalen, a local boy from Stel-
ton, attended St. Peters High School
for four years and is now at Prep for
a P. G. course. Although he has not de-
cided on his future college, Dave plans
to study law.

Dave has a great interest in humani-
ties and philosophy, but he is by no
means a book-worm. In his years at
St. Peters he played varsity football,
basketball and baseball.

As far as school goes, Dave's favorite
subject is English, but his main outside
interest is music, especially his number
one band, Les Brown.

A graduate of Dickinson High School
in Jersey City, Gabe Pitacciato is also
here for a year of post-graduate work.
While at Dickinson High, Gabe played
football, was a member of the golf club,

 

and also played sax and clarinet in
his school band and orchestra. When
he graduates Prep, he hopes to go to
North Carolina University and take up
Chemical Engineering.

Gabe's athletic abilities have already
shown up on the soccer field. Having
a good strong kick with both feet, he
is a great asset to the team.

Gabe's main outside interests are
music (his favorite is symphonic music)
drama, and his ‘46 Plymouth. In school,
his favorite subject is chemistry.

oer

Jerry Ludwig, another post-graduate,
came to Rutgers Prep from neighbor-
ing Brunswick High. He is planning to
go to Rutgers where he expects to
major in engineering.

While at Brunswick Jerry tells us,
he played basketball, baseball, and
(made beer in his cellar). Jerry’s out-
side interests are summed up in three
words: (wine, women and song) and as
far as the women go, his ideal is a
blond with a lot of stuff.

Jerry's taste in music centers around
“Bop” and his favorite band: Les El-
gart.

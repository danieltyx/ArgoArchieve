the battery, and they were most efficient all R

season. We were defeated in our first game ® onta VO Jr
by Montclair H. S., but the following Sat- ’ 5

urday we settled down to business and beat
Drake College of Orange in a ten inning ELLS

game, 5-4. Next, we went to Paterson and lost PALDING’S GOODS

co Paterson H. S$. by a narrow margin, the
PORTING

score being 4-3. The gaine was closely con-
tested throughout and was marked by the
strong stick work of Ziegler. Trenton H. S. ALSO
was the next on the list and when we lined up
for the game we found that we were wu S M

against the same pitcher who shut us out last HEET USIC
year with one scratch hit. However, we start-
ed in confidently and in three innings and a At New York Prices
half, drove out three long hits which netted
us two runs. Unfortunately rain prevented Strings For All Musical Instruments
further playing and we were deprived of an
almost certain victory. Again we went to Ww
Trenton the following week and played Tren- $1.00 DO N

being 14-5 in Prep’s favor. The last game

played was against Pennington Seminary. TALKING MACHINE
This game was the most closely contested
game of the season and was full of surprises
for both sides. Gross pitched a fine game for
Prep. and our fielding was of a high standard R

except for a couple of erratic throws in one MONTALVO, Jr.
inning. The score favored first one team, then

the other, and resulted 7-6 in favor of Pen. ¢99 Neilson St. New Brunswick, N. J.

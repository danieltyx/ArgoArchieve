PREP RALLIES TO NIP KINGSLEY ,36-35

Tretsky's Field Goal Decides Out-
come in Last Five Seconds

Led by Johnny Kluey ana Joey
Tretsky, Prep came from way behind
to beat Kingsley on the upper
George Street Court, 36-35. Ina
heart-breaking slump for three
quarters, Prep suddenly awoke in
the final quarter with a burst of
impossible shots by Kluey, ana
Tretsky's "climax" shet from mia-
court in the last five secon”s
brought to close the most excit-
ing basketball game this year.

Our favored five was being
counted out at the ena of three
quarters by the crowd,for the
Essex Fells visitors were going
great guns with a 33 to 19 leaa,
Still Prep’ remained in a Aeep
coma. Suddenly as if given a
shot in the arm, each Prep passer
came up on his toes, fought for
the ball at every turn, ana pulled
up to 33-31 on a magnificent 12-
point splurge. Kluey was bril-
liant, scoring three of the bas-
kets on adroit one-hand pivot
shots and another from outside the
foul circle from a jump ball.
George Burton's two fouls and Bill
Harper's lay-up accounted for the
other four points.

The partisan crowd, which
had become tonse, seemod to sensc
a Prep victory at this point as
the frantic Kingsley players blew
up, fumbling with the ball, and
passing it wildly in an effort to
seore again. Lon Van Horn, tap-
ped in a basket, after a teom-
mate failed from the foul line to
give the invaders briof respite.
But they were finished as Prep's
fighting forces picked up againe
Bartow sank a long one and Prep
yas tvo points behind. Klucy
made one of a aduble foul, and
Trotsky climaxed the exciting
fray with an arching shot from
mia-court to win the’ game, 36-35,
with only five seconas left.

Prep had scored 17 points in
the rally, while the North Jersey
rival was hela to a brace of fouls

Prep floundcred about like a

period as the visitors shovied

of them, Prep still looked sleep-
y-cyed in the second period, but
more than held thoir own as bas-
kets by "Slim" Horper, "Dainty-

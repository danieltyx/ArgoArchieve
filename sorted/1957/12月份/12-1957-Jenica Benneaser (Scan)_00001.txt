Glee
Varsity R Sponsors
Intramural Sports

The Varsity “R” Club, reinstituted
this year at Prep, sponsored an intra-
mural sports program. However, be-
cause the club is not yet well organized,
the whole burden of the program lay
on only a few of the members, espe-
cially Bernard Karshmer who was
responsible for its success.

This intramural program proved suc- |

cessful at the first attempt, for every-
body enjoyed the intramural soccer
for boys, and the girls were enthusi-
astic rooters. All the boys were divided
into four teams, each coached by one
of the “R” men. Each team played
two games, which were refereed by
members of the “R” club. The result
of this stiff competition was that
Burke’s Bombers and Margolis’ Ma-
rauders tied for first place (0-0), and
Karshmer’s Kool Kat Kickers and
Bromfman’s Bruisers tied for second
Place (1-1).

This was followed by the girls’ intra-
mural basketball, which turned out
just as well. All the girls in R.P.S.
were divided into four teams. Each
team played three games, Jackie's
Jesters taking first place, Barb's
Bobblers second, Sally’s Set Shooters
third, and Arlene’s All Stars fourth.

Encouraged by its success, the Var-
sity “R” Club is planning a third pro-
gram, boys’ intramural basketball,
which everyone is anxiously awaiting.

The Glee Club gave its annual

Students Swing At
Senior Square Dance

by Martin Levowitz

Passers-by and peekers-in were
enraptured on Wednesday, Novem-
ber 27th as they beheld the magnificent |
decorations which had been concocted |
by some of the more progressive |
senior class aesthetes. Everyone agreed |
that Ye Olde Prep Gyme looked very |
much like a barn, and although the
creative geniuses had a_head-start,
they deserve a lot of credit for de- |
vising such a wonderful facsimile. |

The calling was done by Jack)
Vetter, who is a real “vetterin” at|
making square-dances successful. Be- |
tween the stamping feet and the free- |
flowing cider, the gym floor got a}
stimulating massage. |

The dance was arranged by Jackie |
Kaufelt, Arlene Greenberg, Ed Pel- |
lichero, Dick Conrad, Bunny Karshmer |
“Little Levo” Caesarwitz and smiling
Jon Margolis.

The shindig (literally) had some}
exciting features too. Winners of spe- |
cial dances received valuable prizes,
including: a toy carpet-sweeper, a
slightly bent post-card, and an old
purse. The highlight of the evening |
came as birdlike Bruce Gunkle soared
up and grabbed a dangling flower.
Suddenly the air was filled with danc-
{ing colors as a profusion of balloons
floated to earth.

sang for an appreciative crowd.

The concert opened with a series
of traditional Christmas carols. They
were “Joy to the World,” “O Little
Town of Bethlehem,” “Deck the Halls,”

and “The First Noel.” Then follewed
some more serious choral works:
“Sing Now With Great Rejoicing,’/

“Carol of the Bells,” “As it Fell Upon
the Night.”

The chorus from the Elementary
School then moved into the spotlight
singing “Angels We Have Heard On

and “The Sleigh.”

The Glee Club returned and sang
“Welcome Yule,” “Santa Claus is Com-

and “Cantique de Noel,” featuring a
soprano solo by Johanna Rooda.

After the elementary School Chorus
recited “Twas the Night Before Christ-
mas,” the Glee Club sang “Pat-a-Pan,”
“Sing Gloria,” and “Ye Watchers and

with the audience joining the singers
in “Silent Night.”

The Argo
Interveiw With Mr. Gaggini

by James Burke

Prep’s fine French teacher, Mr. Alfred C. Gaggini, is once -again wreaking
his temper on the pupils this year. In spite of this supposed fault, most of his
students emerge from school with a reasonable grasp of the course, and no
fatalities have yet been recorded. Since the material is literally “pounded” into
the students, they either learn or are executed. (French class executions are
carried out by “chairing” the student since no stones are available.) Although
insanity thrives in his classes, everyone will tell you where he ranks: with the
tops.

His sparkling sense of humor has won him many friends the world over.
Last year he traveled to Cambodia, a small country in Southeast Asia, where
he taught English in a National School to French-speaking students. Cambodia,
now having a quite retarded educational system, is growing rapidly. The Prof
remarked, “The number of students in schools in Cambodia has increased
about 300% in recent years, so you can see the country is making progress.”

Concerning his stay in Cambodia, Mr. Gaggini commented, “I had the most
interesting and rewarding experience of my young life but I cannot say IJ
enjoyed it entirely because of the lack of modern conveniences.” Cambodia is
a country with insect-infested food, a scarce supply of fresh water, and above
all, primitive educational facilities. “The greatest value of my stay in Cambodia,”
Mr. Gaggini continued, “was that it made me see the fault of so many Amer-
icans who think they are the best in the world and that everyone should

strive to be like them.”

Explanation of Bumblepuppy
by Jon Margolis

Since you have just read the column
on the left (and if you haven’t, hurry
up and read it; don’t dawdle over this
glop), many of you are probably won-
dering just what bumblepuppy is. We,
the erudite editors of this noble jour-
nal, will now endeavor to explain it.

Everyone wants to be on a team,
and there are those who are. But then
there’s the rest of us, you and me.
What are we to do? Cheer up. For us,
the nothings of the world, bumble-
puppy has been found... Anyone can
make a bumblepuppy team if he can
duck. That is the only talent needed.

Aside from being a source of enjoy-
ment, bumblepuppy also represents
what makes modern America great:
organization. Everyone is on a com-
mittee. A weekly news-letter is being
prepared. The reason that nobody
knows exactly how to play is because
committees are continuously making
rule changes and preparing for the
grand tournament at Madison Square
Garden.

\Letters to the Editor

Dear Editor,
I have been in this school for over
a year. Having joined several clubs, 1

find that they are to my liking. This
year I notice that there
more activities.

Even though I am a freshman, 1
still have the same advantages as g
senior in joining different clubs except
for the chemistry and conservation
clubs.

Each student has some kind of in-
terest which he wants to learn more
about. In just about any interest he
has, the school has a club. The clubs
have many benefits for the student,
They give him a chance to learn more
about the subject he likes, make more
and better friends and still have lots
of fun.

I think the activity schedule worked
out auite well this year. It gives each
student a chance to participate in
any club from science to music any
day of the week.

Feldman had a fair day, but some of
his shots seemed more like rifle blasts
than set shots. Steve Holsten shows
promise but needs much experience
against big guys. As far as Jim Burke
is concerned, just wait; one of these
days he’s going to have a hot streak.

In my opinion. Bruce Gunkle would
do a lot better if he would try to
drive a little rather than bring the
ball to the outside. A few good moves
here and there could be the difference
betwen 23 and 30 points. Last but not
least comes Norm Schubert. Let’s put
it this way — what he lacks in ability,

Although Prep lost by 33 points, our
boys played an excellent game. They
Just couldn’t equal the terrific shoot-
ing of the boys from Brooklyn Poly.

It seems that none of Prep's five
could match Brooklyn's Bob Brower
who scored 41 points. Prep’s Bruce
Gunkle, however, tapped the baskets
for 23 points and Art,
Feldman scored 16 points.

17 points at the end of the first
quarter.

During the second quarter the Prep
five decided to settle down to work.
By means of good team work and
excellent shooting, the “Little Scarlet”
just about matched Brooklyn Poly
throughout the quarter.

After receiving a “pep talk” from
Prep’s new basketball coach, Jim
Dickinson, the boys came out for the
second half ready and raring to go.

During the third and fourth quar-
ters, Prep’s quintet, once again, de-
cided to get down to playing serious
basketball. Throughout the third and
fourth quarters, the “Little Scarlet”
played an excellent game, although it
seemed that the harder Prep tried the
better Brooklyn Poly did.

During the next few weeks the bas-
ketball team will face a tight schedule.
Although Prep dropped its first two
games, the prospects of winning the
next few is very bright.

bigger and better scientific training,
scientific courses, scientific schools,
scientific scholarships,

“This is all to the good, and if

Sputniks I and IT did nothing else than
awaken our countrymen and_ their
political leaders to a crying need we
should be grateful for that alone. But
what will it require to bring about
the realization in the U.S. that it is
not merely more scientific education
that we require, but more education?
This is the real crux of the question
that has been facing the American
people for years, before Sputnik was
ever heard of. The youth of the U.S.
(not to mention their elders) need
greater opportunity and greater incen-
tive and greater direction toward be-
coming educated men and women.

“Scientists and technicians, yes, and
the more the better. But the essential
base before becoming a scientist or
anything else, is to obtain a glimpse
of the broader horizons of life, the
literature, the arts, the history, the
philosophy, the language, the human-
istic studies that constitute the foun-
dations for our culture, and place it
in relation with the ages and the
experiences of mankind that have gone
before. This is what we really need,
what we have always needed, and
what we should make sure does not
get lost in the sudden rally to the
standard of science. Nor is there any-
thing contradictory between stressing
humanistic as well as scientific educa-
tion. The two are not opposites, but
rather correlatives...

“The new emphasis on science will
be self-defeating if we aim to produce
mere technicians rather than educated
men. What we as a nation have to
do goes far beyond establishment of
a few new scholarships or special
projects, desirable as such programs
are. We have to think big in terms
of education as education, aiming to
improve its quality... We have to
revise upward our national attitudes
toward teachers and toward teaching
and educational standards; we have to
build billions of dollars’ worth of
schools and colleges; we have to re-
think the relationship between stu-
dents’ abilities and their opportunity
for higher education; we have to take
a more mature view of what higher
education is and what it is not...”

Numerous Activities

French Visitor Honors Club

The French Club does something
new every week, At several meetings
we saw slides taken on Mr. Gaggini's
trip. They proved very interesting.

We enjoyed a visit from Micheline
Stutuoyner, a French girl. She spoke
little English, so that we were obliged
to speak French. We all asked her
questions. Jim Burke asked her if she
liked American boys, but she kept her
answer to herself. Jackie Kaufelt said
that she had beaucoup de questions,
and between giggles managed to ask
them. After that we listened to French

Conservation Club Reconvenes

The Conservation Club was opened
this year to all members of the senior
class who presented to Mr. Daviet a
composition which gave the students’s
reasons for wanting to become a mem-
ber.

The club is composed of twelve sen-
iors. James Burke was elected presi-
dent, Norman Shubert vice president,
and Sally Searls secratary.

The club plans to do their small
part in any phase of conservation
available to them which might be help-
ful to the state. The first project is
planned for the latter part of Decem-
ber.

Advanced Chem Club
Takes Trip

The recent activities of the Advanced
Chem. Club have led them into two
different, yet fascinating, areas of

 

science. The group with Mr. Daviet
on Friday, December 6 visited the
Photo Products Division of Dupont |
Parlin, where they were given a highly |
inclusive tour by Mr. A. M. Peterson |
and Mr. Wesley Welch. The club en-
joyed this trip immensely and only
wished they could have stayed longer.

During activities period, Thursday,
December 12, Mr. Milton Cowan, Mid-

dlesex County Agriculture Agent, show- |

ed the club the techniques of soil
testing, which the club plans to make
a project of as a service to the com-
munity.

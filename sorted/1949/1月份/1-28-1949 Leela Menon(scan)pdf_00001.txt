LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Sir:

I ama fatalist and a pessimist
and I lack faith in everything,
Because of my misgivings I feel
sure that if Prep were to have
more dances, there would be tre-
mendous turnouts. I base this as-
sumption on the fact that, even
though they are a combination of
borsht and 7-Up, our boys are all
intrigued by the free punch offer-
ed, and would thus all attend, az.
also feel that the only thing
wrong with Prep dances is that
there are not enough of them (for
you know how thirsty Prep boys are
for..epunch.

VANCE SITUATION

Perhaps this is a bad time to
bring up the topic of dances, but
Several, in fact numerous people
in the school, have asked us to go
for more school dances,

Dances as they are now at Prep
are far from what could be undoer-
taken with a little more enthusi-
asm on the part of the Student

 

body, All the work cannot bo done
by a few poople,

It is definitely not up to the
Argo to sponsor dances, we are a
small organization, and by far ,are
unprepared to undertake the job of
preparing a dance, Ie are ,however,
an organization to whom people may
express thoir views, and we of the
staff may oxpress ours,

In this school we have such a
thing as a Student Council, though
one would never know it. To this
date there has been one short cour
cil meeting, held in November, to
vote an extra day vacation if the
football team beat Newark Academy,
Last year there were no meetings.
Each year there are elections to
the council, and each year it turns
into a top rate popularity contest,

It is not the intent of the pa-
per to lambaste the student council
but if there are enough people in
school who agree with us, why not
shake the mildew off the student
council and see if we can get some
more dances. We might suggest a
few informals, they are popular,

SPOTLIGHT

Hi, "Big Lou", It looks like we
caught you in the ray of the spot-
light.

The question, "Who knows Lou
Vasvary"? was asked the other day
and the answer was, "Who doesn't"?
What else could the answer be, for
Lou, one of the best known andbest
liked fellows in school is a gen-
tleman and a scholar, He hails
from New Brunswick High, came to
Prep, and plays football and bas-
ketball, Evon in his popularity
Lou is quiet (especially in the
Plane Geometry Class).

Good Luck to you, Lou!

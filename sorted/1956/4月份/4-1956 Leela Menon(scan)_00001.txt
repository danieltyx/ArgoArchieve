Forty Students
Visit The “Met”
See Rigoletto

On March 16, forty Prep students
attended an annual opera presented by
the Metropolitan Opera Guild.

The presentation was Rigoletto, the
story of a jester. He tempts his master,
the Duke, to get himself a woman. The
Duke is so in love with Rigoletto's
daughter that he has her abducted in-
stead

When Rigoletto discovers the
he goes to the Duke's palace for
daughter. When he finds her, she teils
him of her love for the Duke. The jester
then vows to have revenge.

One night, Rigoletto takes his
daughter to his hired assassin’s house
where they see the Duke flirting with
the assassin’s sister. When the Duke and
Rigoletto leave, Rigoletto’s daughter
overhears the assassin’s plan to kill the
Duke. She sacrifices herself. On his
return, the jester is given the Duke's
body in a sack. Suddenly he hears the
Duke approaching, and, cutting open
the sack, he finds his daughter dead.

The group which attended the opera
was accompanied by Mrs. Wilson and
Mr. Dumarae.

The Argo Ranks 3rd
At C.S.P.A. Meeting

On Saturday, March 17, the ARGO
sent Richard Schwartz and Vic Stil-
well to the annual Columbia Press Con-
ference Association meeting in--New
York. High schools from all over the
United States send representatives to
this convention with their own school
newspaper. The newspapers are scruti-
nized by judges so that a staff may
improve upon its newspaper from year
to year.

The conference, held over a period of
three days, consists of many discussion
clinics and general meetings on all
problems and phases of newspaper work.
All meetings are posted so that students
may’attend those meetings most valu-
able to them, At the general sessions,
students and renowned journalists speak
on journalism and related topics.

The individual newspapers, looked
over by judges, may receive any of
four ratings or none at all, Along with
these ratings, the judges tell students
what is wrong with their publication
and why it didn't rate higher. The
ARGO received a third place rating and
the staff is still awaiting the facts on
the bad features of this paper. This is
the first year that the ARGO has been

 

entered in this convention.

Rehearsing

After Rugged Competition

Rehearsals will soon be underway for Family Cirele by Anne Coulter Martens,
a play in three acts which the Dramatics Club plans to present on the evening

Some of the casting is already com-
pleted and those who have been chosen
for parts are: Amy Riddering to play
the part of Abby; Carl Baratta to play
tne part of William; Steven Hancox
to play the part of Charlie; Clementina
vitti to play Enid; Howard Tobin to
play the part of Otis Skinner; and
Merle Schiffmayer to play Maud
Skinner.

CASTING INCOMPLETE

Some positions in the cast are as yet
unfilled. Under consideration for these
remaining parts are Arlene Greenberg
and Florence Schmitt who are com-
peting for the part of Cornelia Otis
Skinner; Suzanne Duschock and Judy
Anekstein for the part of Grace; Mary
Louise Heldrich and Linda Levy who
are being considered for the part of
Amy, and Florence Schmitt and Arlene
Greenberg who are trying out for the
part of Mab.

THE PLAY IN BRIEF

Briefly, the play concerns itself with
the life of Cornelia Otis Skinner as a
young girl. Cornelia, who has inherited
her parents’ talent for acting, a fact
which has been, up to this time, un-
observed by them, attempts to make her
parents aware of her ability as an ac-
tress. With the help of her friends she
plans and stages scenes from various
Shakesperian plays casting herself as
the leading figure in each one. Invited
to the performance are Cornelia’s par-
ents and some acquaintances whom
she thinks might be interested in
coming.

CORNELIA HAS TROUBLE

However, things do not go as
smoothly as Cornelia had expected. The
effect upon her parents is such that in-
stead of telling her that she is a great
actress, they advise her that she must
start at the bottom of the ladder like
any young person and work her way
up as far as she can,

Family Cirele contains many ridicu-
lous and amusing situations and is
written to hold the interest of the
audience to the last line.

From The
Editor’s Desk

As most of you probably know, this
issue of The Argo is the last issue that
will be published by the present staff.
The last issue of the paper, which will
come out in May, will be run by an
entirely new staff.

During the year I have received many
comments about this paper, some very
complimentary others not so compli-
mentary. I have been approached by
many students with ideas for improving
this paper. I appreciate any suggestions
that are given me but I feel that be-
fore venturing into any new project
this paper must first get an efficient
and cooperative reporting and writing
staff.

With each issue the editorial staff is
faced with the problem of getting re-
porters to write articles. As a result of
this problem over two thirds of the
paper is generally written by the edi-
torial staff. Such a small group can-
not do all the work on the paper. Help
is needed. Because it will be done by
a new staff, the last issue of The Argo
will be extremely hard to publish.
Don’t shirk your responsibility towards
your school paper. Let's make the Argo
a publication we can all be proud of,

The Argo

Letters to the Editor

vear Editor: ; ;

I personally think the Argo is a fine
newspaper for a school the size of ours.
Only a small, capable group cnooses
this activity, and the Argo and Argo-
mag are only as good as these few stu-
dents make them. With only limited
help from members of the student body,
the Argo staff practically has to run
the paper alone. This is a difficult task.
Since the paper is mainly for the en-
joyment of Prep students and is about
our activities, everyone should try to
help. I am sure almost everyone looks
forward to the Argo. Yet, honestly, do
we make any real effort to contribute?
I do not mean to condemn everyone,
because, of course, there are a few
faithful helpers, but on the whole our
spirit is depressing and limited. Oiten
we can hear classmates in critical dis-
cussion of our newspaper. Truthfully,
however, how can we expect to receive
more when there is nothing offered?
f we would spend more time in im-

 

  
 

  

proving paper than in criticizing if,
our Argo ld see better times and
opinions.

Sincerely yours
A student.
Dear Editor:

Soon everyone will be thinking about
EXAMS. The very word immediately
frightens some. Students are terrified
at the first knowledge of exams. We
sometimes do not realize that exams
will help, not hinder us if we do well.

By giving exams, teachers are not
trying to trick us; they are merely
testing us on the work we have studied.
Exams are given to raise our grades.

To receive good grades we, of course,
must study. Many students leave study-
ing until the last minute and stay
awake the entire night before exams
trying to catch up on work which
should have been done daily through
classroom work and homework.

At the time of the exam it is advis-
able to be well rested and in fit condi-
tion. Everyone is a little nervous, but
if you know the material the test is
on you should feel confident.

High school exams prepare us for the
harder exams at college. In our school

the schedule for exams is conveniently |* *

arranged. A week is devoted for the
study, review, and actual taking of the
exams.

Taking exams is a challenge to see
whether we have retained the knowl-
edge accumulated during the semester's
work,

During life we will have to meet
certain challenges which will be much
the same as exams, calling upon our
ability, our knowledge, and resourceful-
ness. Exams throughout the school years
will better pave our way for a better
future in life.

Sincerely,

 

Linda Levy.

Little Searlet’s Hopefuls for 56 Baseball Season,

 

SPOR TLIGHT
By Joe Messina

The Sportlight for this month shines
on two of the best ballplayers ever to
set foot on Prep’s diamond-Bob Tam-
maro and George Friedlander. Both,
through their leadership and superior
ability, led their respective teams to
winning seasons.

A product of Jamesburg High, Tam-
my has played varsity short-stop for
four years and established a fine record
for himself throughout the county.
Besides maintaining a superior field-
average, Tammy was consistently
Batting a respectable .333

ig
a .300 hitter.
n his junior year he improved himself
to lead his team with a .380 average
last year. At the end of the season he
was honored by being cited by many
as one of the outstanding players in
the county and state.

On the defensive side of the ledger
is port-side, fireballer George Fried-
Jander of Plainfield. Pitching four year's

of varsity ball, “Porky” really came
through last year with a 6-1 record.
Besides his great pitching talent,

Georgie also had great hitting ability.
George, as well as Tammy, was voted
one of the most outstanding ballplayers
in Union county.

With both “Porky” and Tammy on
our team this year, we are sure to have
a successful season.

Incidently, it has just been announced
Marty Metzger was elected to the All-
Prep All-State basketball team.

FLASH!

Rutgers Prep opened its ’56 baseball
season by bowing to highly talented
Sayreville H.S. Bruce Gunkle pitched
the entire game for the Prepsters allow-
ing 6 runs on 4 hits. Stan Rosenblum
and Bob Tammaro were offensive stand-
outs for Prep. The final score was 6-2.

Coach Picks Varsity j and J.V. Teams

BY PETER WINTERSTEINER

In a recent interview, Coach O’Con-
nell outlined the baseball activities for
this season. Although the pre-season
snows have halted progress somewhat,
Coach had the Prepsters’ ball team go
through several workouts, before the
opening game. The first game was on
March 15, in the Rutgers Field House.
In addition to these practices, there

‘}were a few scrimmage games. These
, | Scrimmages included a game with the

Rutgers University freshmen.
Here is how the Varsity team shapes

4 up. Our leading pitcher is George Fried-

lander, who played for Plainfield last
year. He has good control and is fast.
Bruce Gunkle, now a freshman, looked
good last year and is improved this
season. Bob Torrone adds relief strength

_ |and plays at other positions also.

Bob Tammaro, captain of the team,
is the starting shortstop. He is fast and
a very good fielder. Marty Metzger
seems to have nailed down the first
base job. He’s an especially good hitter.
Carl Baratta, one of last year’s letter-
men, is playing left field. Stan Rosen-
blum will be playing second when he
is not catching. He also has a letter
in this sport.

The other positions are filled but still
remain subject to change. Joe Messina,
Tom Molskow, Bob Fiermonti, Fred
Fulham and many others are at their
best in trying to win a permanent
starting position on the squad. Each
pitcher will double in the outfield when
he isn't on the mound.

Nothing definite has been settled
about the Junior Varsity and Fresh-
man teams. The schedule will be re-
leased shortly.

PG‘s Seniors Receive
College Acceptances

Several seniors have been accepted
at colleges throughout the country.
However many others are still waiting
for their March college board results
before they can receive answers to their
applications.

Bob Tammaro has been accepted at
both Wagner and Rider colleges. He
would like to go to Bucknell but has
not received any word from there yet.
His second choice would be Albright.

Marion Thompson has received an
acceptance from Green Mountain Jun-
ior College. After graduating from jun-
ior college, Marion plans to attend
nursing school. Marian Veale has been
accepted at Katherine Gibbs Business
School, which she expects to enter in
the fall.

Barbara Brennen, a junior taking a
post-graduate course at Prep, has been
accepted at St. Peters Nursing School
for the coming year. Bill Romig has
received a letter of acceptance from
Case Institute of Technology in Chicago,
but he does not plan to go there. Stan
Rosenblum has been accepted at Wash-
ington College, and Bob Torrone, an-
other post-graduate, has been accepted
at Georgia Institute of Technology.

 

LOWER SCHOOL NEWS

Prior to spring vacation, many of the
classes presented plays for the enjoy-
ment of parents and students alike. The
kindergarten offered two plays, The
Crows and The Three Bears. The
Golden Goose was presented by the
fourth grade while the fifth grade pro-
duced Aunt Emmy and the Monkey.
The sixth grade’s play was unique in
that the members of the class wrote it
themselves. It was a mock radio pro-
gram and was extremely funny. Differ-
ent class members portrayed various
characters from books.

Many students have been having
trouble in concentrating on their less-
ons. As the new library is almost com-
pleted, the area near the school is
being landscaped. Several bulldozers
and other machines are very distract-
ing, especially to the boys. Blacktop
walks are to be laid between the build-
ings leading up to the library entrance.

Soon after classes resumed on April
3, Mrs. Kehoe read the honor roll.
There was no marked increase or dec-
line in the number of students on the
first and second honor rolls and those
who received honorable mention.

Inquiring Reporter
By Florence Schmitt

QUESTION — What is your idea of the
ideal student?
REPLIES — My idea of the ideal
student is —

Mr. Holley — “one who has intellectual
curiosity and makes the most of it.”

Mr. Kallfelz — “a balanced person who
knows how to work and how to play
at the proper time.”

Mr. O'Connell — “a pleasant, happy
individual who knows that ‘there 1s
a time and a place for everytning.’’

Mr. Daviet — “one who is intellectually
curious, well-mannered, industrious,
well-groomed, has a pleasant person-
ality, and mature behavior.”

Mr. Moffat — “one who has creative
curiosity and plenty of energy.”

Mr. Blake — “one who has superior
mentality, desire to learn, and who is
cooperative and unselfish.”

Mr. Dumarae — “one who has intellec-
tual curiosity tempered with sensitiv-
ity, humility, and a zeal for labor.’

Mrs. Wilson — “one who reads and
connects what he reads with his life.”
Bill Romig — “one who possesses ade-

quate intelligence and the will to
learn.”

Howard Tobin — “one who is willing
to work and who minds his own
business.”

Dick Schwartz — “a person who has
energy, initiative, and personality.
This means he must be willing to
work, pleasant to know, and he must
have a goal.”

Mr. Heinlein — “one who could recog-
nize or distinguish between the serious
and non-serious aspects of school
life and meet these situations with a
corresponding behavior pattern.”

Alan Rackmill — “I refuse to commit
myself on the grounds that someone
might think I am conceited.”

Marion Thompson — “one who is kind,
courteous, tries hard, and is a lot of
fun. Also, he is an all-around student
and has a lot of school spirit.”

Mr, Gaggini — “This is very difficult
because the characteristics of ideal
students vary even among them. I
think that any serious student can
answer this question for himself, even
better than the teachers can.”

Jaycees Sponsor
Teenage Road-e-o

During March, April and May, the
Junior Chamber of Commerce through-
out the nation will be making last
minute plans for the community teen-
age Road-e-os. In 1956 the Jaycees
will bring the program to a half million
teen-agers in nearly two thousand com-
munities.

During the week of April 16, a quali-
fying written test involving general
knowledge of driving safety and skill
will be given to all eligible contestants
from Prep who wish to prove their
ability to drive. Those contestants who
get the five highest written scores will
be allowed to take a driving test at 10
A.M. Saturday, April 28, at the French
Street parking lot.

High scoring contestants in the com-
munity Road-e-os will go to the state
eliminations.

The written and performance tests
are made tougher in the state Road-
e-os and a third portion of testing is
added, a in-traffic-road-check.

In August the winners of the state
Road-e-os will fly to Washington D.C.
for an expense paid week of activities
including a battery of six Road-e-o
examinations. The three high scoring
contestants will receive $1,500.00,
$1,000.00 and $500.00 scholarships.

The teen-age Road-e-o is for any
boy or girl who will not have reached
twenty years of age by August 9, who
has a drivers license or permit and who
has a clean record of no moving traffic
violations in the past six months.

Cars for the community contest will
be furnished by local dealers, and con-
testants will have the opportunity to
choose a Ford, Plymouth or a Chevrolet
with standard or automatic transmis-
sion. Insurance for both the car and
the contestant will be furnished.

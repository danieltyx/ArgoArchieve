CENSUS

Midyears have come and gones
Shall we say that they were more
or less rugged?

Gommunities take stock of the
damage after a storm. We feel we
should do as much.

An intelligent survey proves the
damage rathor low. The infirmary
reports no increase in busincss.
Aspirin sales in local drug stores
have fallen off. No one was dis-
covered hanging from lamp posts.
In fact, students are scon smilirg
a little more now. Aside from an
inflated ego here and there, and
a fow shattered prides, wo seem
to be in pretty good shape to bo-
gin our trek on tho home stretch.

In closing, wo might say that no
canvass could be made of the many
home lectures givon...our staff
nover intrudes on privacy.

"HEAR YE

This week we aro starting a new
_ feature in the Argo which will ap-
_ pear in each successive issud, Tho
‘picture of the Week" will bo sel-
ected from the pictures that will
be taken and submitted by yous
Some of the photographic possibil-
ities are: athletics, dances,life

glee
at
school in general, The picture
will be selected for its photo-
graphic quality, the subject mat-
ter, and the timeliness of the
subject. By timeliness we mean 4
picture on football would not be
as apropos as one on basketball at
this time. There are no prizes.
Just competition, and the questim-
able distinction of having your
picture appear in the Argo.
Anyone can participate, whether
a camera fan or not. If this idea
is supported, we may enlarge upon
it. It's up to you. Place nega-
tives in Gil Eiseman's mail box.

¥E DEAL

Freshmen, Sophomores, Juniors,
you are the future Seniors of this
school. It's up to you to get out
a yearbook, The Ye Dial needs you,
you, and you. Every year senior
staff membors graduate and someone
has to take their places. When you
graduate you will want to have a
yearbook. You can't unless you
assume some responsibility now.
The Yo Dial needs ads and more ads.

We need you to help us--don't let
us down.

AMAZING

If a Prepster ever employed the
word tamazing! in his vocabulary ,
I'm sure he'd be speaking of Mason
Martens. His performance at mid-
year in achieving an 88.5 average
is indced amazing, considering the
fadt that he failed to certify one
subject, in the eyes of a Prepstor
a former Prepster, or even a nan
Prepster,.

If I wore to ennumerate Mason's
attributes and his defects, much
working space and time would be
consumed. However it suffices to
say that he maintains and employs
a plethoric amount of cach.

Vie have been told time and time
again that our glee club is one of

. the most important functions of

this school. To this organization

Mason has devoted time and effort
by the truckload. His accompani-
ment and transposition of pieces

has greatly eased Ir. Grove's
struggle 1 with forty changing
voices.

Mason's main interest, of course,
is music, Handel's, to be specifia
Music of the church and churches
themselves, hold a fascination for
him also.

Delineation and diesstion cannot
be discussed by me, or by any one
in Rutgors Preparatory School,sim-
ply because there is little true
undorstanding,

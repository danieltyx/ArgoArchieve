ONSTI TUTION —

The. reason “for ma ing officers
of the Student Council ineli;
ble to hold office in their own
classes is to enable more stu-
dents of the school to enter in-
to activities. This would pre-

vent the necessity of electing
supplementary delegates to the
Student Council who would not
be class officers; rather,each
delegate would be in charge of
such class projects as dances
funds, etc..

other dance in the past. The Stu-
dent Council, proviously a popular-

ty contest, has comc to life and
begun planning many oxtra curricu-
lar activitios. The very fact
that you are reading a school paper
is an occurrence students in the
past fow years were unable to cx-

Unfortunately there is less par~
ticipation on tho part of the
studont body as a whole in activi-
ties than wo would like to sce.
Most of our students come from
other schools and find it hard to
transfor their loyalty to our
school. Thore is still the necos-
sity of button-holing rooters, of

On October 17 wo again had our
famous Barn Dance jamboree, It
was an oxcellont night when ovory-
ono wes drossod like hicks, when
everybody had a swoll timo. The
biggest haysoed of the evening was
Wialt Quinn, who with his young
dairymaid looked so natural in the
surroundings that he (and she )
walked off with the best looking
farm couple prize. The prize, a
huge dish of assorted ico creams
ond goos (a Moron's Dolight) was
quickly devoured bv Quinn and
Company. . . and many other energot-
ic young couples. .

‘Ialking into the gymnasium, one
could soc a multitude of students
and toschoers, somo doncing to the
music, and others drinking cider
and cating doughnuts. Still othors
stood looking in amazement at the
corn stalks and other pictures on
tho well. (Take a curtain call,
LoBow!)

Toward the ond of tho ovening
whilo most of the students wore
rosting from the vigorous danccs,
tho robust members of tho faculty
wore dancing with never-ending
gracofulness. Whoro did they got

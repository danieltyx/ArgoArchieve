Council Changes School Constitution

Council Presents
Plans For Trip

The Student Council in a recent

ee ee
& “¢

‘

  

meeting proposed a school trip to the ol

Franklin Institute in Philadelphia to! §

take place on March 25, 1955.

The proposal was passed unanimous-
ly by the council members and received
approval from the faculty. The money
which will be used to finance the trip
will be taken from the student activ-
ities fund.

There will be three busses hired so
that all of the student body and
faculty members can go. The busses
will leave Prep at about 9:00 A.M. and
return at about 7:00 P.M.

Students are required to pay their
own admission fees and to bring or
buy their own lunches. There is a
lunch canteen at the Franklin Insti-
tute where all Prepsters will get lunch
at 11:30 A.M. before going to the
museum at twelve.

The museum does not open until
noon. By going then Prep will be able
to take advantage of the entire sched-
ule of hours the institute is open to
the public.

The subjects contained in the mu-
seum concern themselves mainly with
physics, but other sciences are in de-
tailed exhibit. The exhibits include even
a full size steam engine.

Headmaster Reveals
Parents’ Conference

“Mr. Heinlein has announced that
something new will be added at Prep.
For the first time all the students’
parents will be able to come into the
school and have extensive talks with the
teachers. The teachers will try to ex-
plain why Prep prepares its students
so well for college.

The headmaster has expressed his
opinion that the new innovation should
prove to be very popular. The parents
will be able to ascertain just why Prep
is a better school for college prepara-
tion. The meetings wil be held in the
evening on special dates, starting
around the 24th of the month.

Seniors Take Reins
As Teachers Relax

Through the efforts of the Student
Council, there will be a Senior Day at
Prep again this year on April 15. It
has become a tradition at Prep for the
past few years to give the seniors a
chance to take over all the classes in
school and teach them in the best
possible manner.

Senior Day has become very popular
at Prep in the little while that it has
been in existence. The students try very
hard not to make it too difficult for
the seniors to teach the classes. It is
a day of new experiences and jubila-
tion for all Prepsters.

Mr. Heinlein has expressed his
opinion that he is hopeful of success
again this year. He feels that this day
of student activity serves to acquaint
the students with some of the problems
of teaching. He also said that it should
be fun for both teachers and students.

Small Group Visits Concert

On February 10th, several students
attended a concert given by the Boston
Symphony Orchestra at the Rutgers
University Gymnasium. Featured on the
program were Margaret Harshaw, fam-
ous operatic soprano, and Pierre Mon-
tieux, guest conductor. The program
consisted mainly of Wagner’s Tann-
hauser, featuring Miss Harshaw, the
well-known Wagnerian soprano. Those
students who attended the concert were
Roger Seamon, Clifford Griggs, Anita
Sture, and Clemmie Vitti.

 

 

 

Prepster Party Fulfills Pledge
Original Campaign Platform

On January 4, the Student Council
drew up a list of amendments to be
added to the Constitution. After much
debate and a final revision they were
presented to the student body for a
vote.

The amendments were set up in three
parts. Part I concerns elections. It in-
cluded changing the time of the stu-
dent officers’ election from September
to May, and specified from which class-
es the officers of the council were to
be chosen. Election of class represen-
tatives was still to be held in the fall
and a provision was included concern-
ing elected officers not returning in
the fall.

Part II gave the student body the
power to vote on any legislation which
will affect the entire school. However,
it reserved the right to decide which
legislation was to receive such approval.

Part III dealt with the members of
the Council who were unable to attend
the meeting, and who wished to send
Substitutes in their place.

The vote by the student body passed
all of these amendments and they be-
came part of the Constitution. The
Council passed the amendments by a
majority vote and the student body
by a unanimous vote.

Printed Argo Mag Successful

Receiving Many Compliments

The first Argomag of the year was
given to the student body on Friday,
Feb. 4. It was considered greatly im-
proved over previous years. Mr, Hein-
lein congratulated Stu Edelberg, editor-
in-chief, and his fine staff on the ex-
cellence of the magazine.

The greatest improvement in the
Argomag was in its publishing. It was
printed for the first time in its history.
The cover was especially attractive
done on a heavy white embossed paper.
It was inked in maroon and was only
a very plainly drawn geometric pattern
done by Pete Schwartz. Contributions
from all five classes were included.

News of the revised Argomag was
published in the January issue of the
Independent School Bulletin.

Student Council Rates High
by John Bodnar

Our Student Council is an effective
and efficient organization. Its func-
tioning has enabled many activities,
which otherwise would have been un-
successful, to go off smoothly and prove
both enjoyable and beneficial to the
students. The council has made it pos-
sible for us to be proud of our school
and its student government. It was the
council's idea that we have emblems
to put on our books and cars, to show
our pride in the school.

Through the efforts of the Student
Council, a trip to the Franklin Institute
has been made possible for the whole
student body. This will be provided with
no transportation cost to the students.

We should all thank the council
for good jobs well done.

GUIDANCE PERIOD?

Something must be done about the
activities period. Perhaps more of an
emphasis on guidance by the faculty
members would be most helpful to
students just sitting in on this period.

The period was supposed to be set
aside so that almost all of the students
could in one way or another take part
in some activity. As it now stands the
period has been turned into one of stu-
dy for almost every student.

The faculty should try to get to-
gether with the Student Council and

come to some agreement upon what can
be done.

The Argo
Letters to the Editor

Dear Editor:

I would like to make a few critical
remarks on the topic of dances at the
gym. While joyfully dancing around
the gym, one gazes up at the ceiling
of beams with basketball nets hanging
down from it. Maybe we could borrow
$300 from the school to cover the ceil-
ing, but then there would be the prob-
lem of walls. After covering the walls
with knotty pine, what could we do
about the floor? We could always
simonize it, but who will do it? Usually
there’s a mob of about five people who
show up to decorate, and they probably
could rearrange the whole gym. That is
a perfect spot for dances if we could
have a professional interior decorator
helping us, but since you can't, I sug-
gest we hold our dances somewhere
else.

Angrily yours,
“Hangy”

Dear Editor:

I have read all the letters which were
printed in the Argo and in my opinion,
they were printed only to take up space.
I think what I have to say is worth
while printing. It has to do with our
activities period. At the beginning of
the school year in September, the en-
tire student body was told that the
activities period was put into effect
for the benefit of the students alone.
We were told that during this activities
period we could read anything we liked
and have clubs or activities which
would be proper school functions. In
my estimation this period is a lot of
bunk. First of all, we are not allowed
to read anything we want. The club
that I am interested in isn’t allowed
to meet any more because the members
are being punished for low grades. The
only thing this period generally leads
to is an extension of the school day.
I think Mr. Stuart Edelberg and his
Student Council should stop making
plans for a school dance and get to-
gether with the faculty to try to im-
prove this period.

Thank you,
Bob Fiermonti

No Change In Library Rates

The book fine in our school library
of twenty-five cents per day up to the
price of the book still stands unchang-
ed. Some students complained of the
high fines so the Student Council re-
solved to alter it.

However, on March 4, the Student
Council plans to present these sugges-
tions again to the faculty. If nothing
happens, the old fine of twenty-five
cents will be retained. The English De-
partment is open to any suggestions

 

the student body might have.

Evaluation Begins At Prep

As part of the Cooperative Study of
Secondary School Standards, the Stu-
dent Council has filled out a pamphlet
entitled Pupil Activities Program.
This survey consists of a number of
pamphlets, each covering a segment of
the school set-up, which are filled out
by the various departments. The pam-
phlets are then sent to Washington,
D. C. where they are then evaluated.

The evaluation of the pupil activity
program was done for the Student
Council by Stu Edelberg, Clemmie Vitti,
and Roger Seamon.

In the pamphlet, a phase of the
school program is stated and there is
a blank which follows. In this blank
is inserted a mark indicating how this
particular provision or condition is car-
ried out in the program.

In addition to this, there are ques-
tions which determine the overall char-
acter of the pupil activity program,
and blanks in which are inserted any
additional comments.

cludes Pupil Participation in School

SPORILIGH1

by Cliff Griggs

This edition of the “Sportlight” will
tell why the students must support
the team more. Many things are going
on that some of our students are not
aware of.

eee

Let us t.y to talk a little on the
school representation at our basketball
games. Most people do not seem to
realize that our team is doing a mar-
velous job. As the record now stands,
we have fourteen wins and one loss. It
seems to me that with such a good re-
cord the students would have some
desire to cheer the Prepsters on.

eer

If we are to be invited to the Head-
masters’ Tournament this year, the
team has to keep the pressure on.
Pingry has always been a big stumbl-
ing block in the past and probably will
be blocking the way to triumph again.
The students must stick with the team
if they want to be called part of it.
Every person has some desire to be
part of a winning organization. The
rooters are very much a part of the
Little Scarlet.

Our team not only represents the
school well in athletics but also in stu-
dies. Special notice must be given to
certain members of the team. Roger
Lambertson and Roger Seamon acquir-
ed averages of 90 and 87 respectively.
Credit also must be given to Stan
Rosenblum and Bert Sathmary who
showed themselves to be superior in
scholastics.

 

Junior Varsity Wins
As Baratta Nets 12

The Prep J.V. team won its third
game in five starts under the expert
coaching of Mr. O'Connell. From the
opening buzzer Prep took command and
went on to win 36-33. High scorer for
the Little Scarlet was Carl Baratta with
12 points. Joe Messina, Andy Pis-
catelli and Martin Bertman collected
10, 5 and 4 points respectively. Pingry’s
Kipe, however, topped all scorers with
21 counters in the losing cause.

Although playing a better team, Prep
players showed great stamina. Coach
O'Connell did an excellent job in in-
structing and manuevering the inferior
team, and they showed a will to win
that was lacking in other games.

Gary Stratton Stars For Prep.

Limelight

Roger “Lambie” Lambertson came to
Prep this year as a postgraduate. He
formerly attended Hoffman High
School in South Amboy.

“Lambie’s” scholastic ability rates
as high as his sports ability. Last fall
he was a great asset to the soccer team
as a right-inside. He is also a member
of the first string varsity basketball
team where he holds down guard posi-
tion. As well as participating in these
sports, “Lambie” manages to maintain
a 90 average.

He was president of the Chem Club
for a half year and he did a fine job
for preparing the experiments for the
club.

“Lambie” also writes for the Argo
and helped with the editing for the
Argomag.

Besides being active in school, “Lam-
bie” has another accomplishment.
Every morning he brings practically the
whole basketball team to school in his
Austin. It’s pretty comical to see five
or six boys all pile out of his car.

In his future years, “Lambie” plans
to go on to Lehigh College and major
in engineering.

their 13th victory. The 74-69 defeat

was received unwillingly by the Admiral Farragut Academy of Pine Beach.

Jerry Gorezyca and Gary Stratton
set the pace for the Little Scarlet with
27 points each, and both Roger Lam-
bertson and Roger Seamon helped the
victorious cause with 6 points each.

Prep Takes Lead

Admiral Farragut took a 2-0 lead in
the opening seconds of play, but Gor-
lead.
Coach Dick O’Connell’s five kept pour-
ing the ball through the hoop until
they held a 21-14 advantage at the
period’s end.

Farragut managed to find the range
for 15 points as compared to 14 for
Prep in the 2nd stanza, but the Little
Scarlet ended the first half with a
six point lead.

Coach O'Connell's half time strategy
showed in the third stanza as Prep
mounted up a 54-46 spread before the
period’s end.

Fighting Finish

The middle of the fourth period
found Prep holding a 4 point lead
over Admiral Farragut, but Stratton
hit for 2 more tallies to raise the score
to 70-64. Shipiro hit for 5 points while
Gorezyca scored 2 counters. This left
the Little Scarlet ahead by only 3
points in the game.

The 13th victory for the Little Scar-
let was obtained in their 14th start
with the only defeat received by the
mighty Pingry five of Elizabeth. Prep
will most likely face Pingry again in
The Headmasters’ Tournament in
March and will have to defeat them
in order to take the tournament.

LOWER SCHOOL NEWS

by
Nancy Lee and Florence Schmitt

Mid-year examinations were held at
the lower school in regular class hours
during the week of January 24. Report
cards have been sent to the pupils’
homes. Class meetings with parents are
now being held for the purpose of im-
proving school-parent relationships.

On Friday, February 4, the sixth
grade visited the Geology Museum of
Rutgers University. Dr. Bennet Smith
of the Geology Department spent over
an hour explaining the numerous ex-
hibits. The sixth grade had recently
been studying about rock formations;
therefore, the demonstration of miner-
als under fluorescent lights was of
particular interest.

A number of seventh grade pupils
are entering exhibits in the second an-
nual Science Fair, which will be held
on April first and second.

Some of the lower grades are plan-
ning to give Spring plays and have
started practicing for them. Mrs, Han-
cox’ second and Mrs. Lipman’s third
grade plan to give Peter Pan, an operet-
ta, in March. Mrs. Eby’s second grade
is making its own scenery for its play,
The Traveling Musician.

The students in the lower school art
classes, under the instruction of Mrs.
Mildred Ford, are learning to make
wall paper designs which they find
very interesting and enjoyable.

SS

Teachers Attend Conference

On Tuesday, February 15, the Foreign
Language Conference, sponsored by the
Association of Heads of Independent
Schools of Northern New Jersey, was
held at the Short Hills Country Day
School. Theodore Anderson, Professor
of French at Yale University, delivered
the main address. Mr. Heinlein, Mr.
Dumarae, and Mr. Gaggini attended
the conference which lasted from 3:30
to 8:30 P.M.

The purpose of this conference was
the discussion of the trends which
foreign languages will take in the near
future. It was pointed out that, since
our relationships with other nations is
steadily growing, the use of foreign
languages, especially French, is becom-
ing increasingly important. Plans are
being made, therefore, for fuller and
more extensive language courses in
the secondary grades, and the teaching
of foreign languages in the elementary
schools.

‘Round About Rutgers
by Bill Romig

The Winter Edition of the Argomag
met with very favorable comment by
Ernestine Robinson, ex-president of the
Columbia Scholastic Press Association.
Mr. Moffat showed a copy of our litera-
ry efforts to Miss Robinson, who is
currently a judge of school magazines
that are submitted to the Association
for competitive honors.

Mr. Daviet took the Chemistry Club
on an excursion to the Museum of Sci-
ence and Industry at Rockefeller Cen-
ter, New York City, on Tuesday, Feb-
ruary 22nd. The museum's extensive
exhibits cover every field of industry
and all branches of science that apply
to industry. There is also a very com-
plete and interesting exhibit of syn-
thetic fabrics and synthetic rubber.

The Rutgers Prep Spring Party
promises to be the big social event of
the spring season. It will be held March
12th, beginning at 7:30 P.M. at the
Prep Gym and is under the chairman-
ship of Pete Schwartz, assisted by Ted
Kalli and the committee. John Clayton
and his orchestra will provide the music
for dancing. As this is a party, it is
quite in order to come stag.

S.E.B. Holds Annual Meeting

The Twenty-ninth Conference of the
Secondary Education Board will be
held March 4 and 5 at the Hotel Statler
in New York.

The Secondary Education Board
furnishes independent schools with
standardized examinations, and one of
the main purposes of the conferences
is to discuss these examinations and
make improvements in them. The
examinations cover a wide field includ-
ing English, Science, Mathematics,
Latin and Modern Languages. At the
numerous meetings, any teacher who
has used an S.E.B. exam and is dis-
pleased with it may discuss the exam
and propose revisions.

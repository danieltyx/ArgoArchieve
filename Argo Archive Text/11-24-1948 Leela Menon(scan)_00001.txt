THANKS GIVING
FOUR GAY HOLIGHY

On Thursday, Novombor 25, the
whole nation will again coLobrate
Thanksgiving Day. This doy 1s sot
aside by tho Prosidont and Govern=
ors so that the poople of the
United States may give thanks to
God for the good tilings that thoy
havo roceived during the past yoar.
This holiday is colobratod in the
48 states and all the possossions.

Tho origin of Thanksgiving Day
goes all the way back to 1621, when
the Pilgrims, who had como the
previous year from England, invit-
ed everyone in the colony of
Plymouth to the first harvest
feast, consisting of turkey and
all the trimmings. This custom of
feasting after the harvost was
carried on often during that, and
the ensuing contury.

Thanksgiving Day has boen used
for many purposes other than to
offer thanks for a good harvest.

Tn 1789, President Washington set
aside a day to commomorate tho
ratifying of the Constitution; in
1815 President Madison offered a
day thanking God for the return of

‘peacee In 1863, Presidont Lincoln

issued a proclamation making

BE A PREPSTER

The football team has done a
good job this year in earning a
good reputation for themselves
and Prep. Yet while they were out
there plugging all the way, many
Prepsters couldn't decide whether
or not to go to the next game.

Football is over now, and
basketball is taking its place in
the sports spotlight. You have a
swell bunch of fellows out there
working for you, so why don't you
show them that you appreciate it?

Certainly, no one can deny
that, up to now you have made a
rather poor showing in backing
the team. Because our school is
smallex than many we should be
more united, and possess more
school spirit.

Here's a list of cures for
that bored lazy feeling. If you
will do one or more of the follow-
ing you will be rid of that dusty
stuff that surrounds your spirit.
1. Go out for, or go to basketball
games,
ee Attend the glee club concerts,
and dances.

3. Become a reporter for the Argo,
or take pictures for Ye Dial.

4, ilelp make social events a
success, and don't pass up the
Theatre Club!

Get a move on now, surely that
reading and writing stuff isn't
that interesting.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

any times, so far this year,
we of the Argo staff have held
meetings, each with the idea of,
" What will be good for the sch-
ool, as well as interesting! je
are trying to organize a Theatre
Club, we are plugging all sport-
ing events, we held a student
ballot, and plan to hold more in
the future, to see just what your
opinions are on various subjects.
Recently we thought up the idea
of having a " Letters to the
Gaitor “column, in which you, of
the student body, could submit
ideas, criticisms, or possibly
things praising us.

This is now the fourth issue
of the argo, and we have received
to date 2 letters, only one of
which was of any interest to the
school as a whole. This is your
paper, without your support we
can not hope to achieve the goals
we set when we restarted it. So
think it over, and let's have
some letters instead of verbal
crittes, who only look with scorn.

possessions, while the governors
of the states set aside a day
also, in their respective states.
Until the last few years the day
did not coincide, and in various
parts of the country Thanksgiving
was celebrated on a different day,
In the past few years, however,

it has been standardized and now
the whole country celebrates this

day 22 the last Thursday in the
month,

DANCE 4 SUCCESS

Last Saturday night the gym at
Prep was the scene of society life
here on the campus, Once again
the annual football dance got un-
derway, and with it the usual
amount of Jive, Jitterbug, and
Jazz, The music was furnished by
George Bache and his orchestra,
who, by the end of the evening,
had everyone impressed with swing
and sway arrangements.

The Jitterbugging was furnished
by our own local talent aided by
their pert and beautiful dates,
Possibly Dr, Gallup and some of
his learned colleagues could take
a lesson from sone of the Prop
boys who were polling 1000 as far
as picking their dates was con-
cerned, As the evening drew to a
close and the couples began filing
out, I could tell by their smoking
foet that they had become quite
heated up at the dance,

Vie all owe a unanimous vote of
apprecltation to the members of the
faculty, and the student body, who

contributed so much toward making
this dance the success that it was,

BETA HOUSE “BUBBLES”

This is the Beta House:

On floor number 1 we have the din-
ing room, where evaluators are fate
tened up, On floor number 2 we may
peek in and see a coatless, grumb-
ling gentleman slouched stiffly in
a newly upholstered chair, glasses
on forehead, and reading a copy of
the Saturday Evening Post, Next
door there is a young man who

dries coffee beans and tobacco on
the radiator and who says of the
students, "Let them have A.M,"
Finishing off the second floor we
have the "Bronx Bombshell", Irwin
Roth, and two bathrooms,

Storming the third floor (just to
be different) a rather brawny lump
of flesh may be seen combing his
hair and mumbling to himself, He's
so quiet, sometimes, that one rare-
ly knows just what he is thinking.
Next door is a person who seems to
own only underwear and red hair,
His fingers are usually dabbling
on paper---with many colors, tho
results of which send his next door
neighbor into fits of revulsion and
shock, This one is a highly moral
individual who holds 100% stock in
"Dates, Inc," and other "nice
things", The "nico one's" room-
mate is what 1s known in short as a
character, His melodious ditties
and quaint tales of foreign and
domestic women aro constantly mar-
voled at by the inhibited unfortu-
nates who live with him, (Before we
turn the corner to visit the two

uals, we would like to state that
these of whom we've trld you are
real people. That's all, One ro-

Rutgers Prep tallied once i
first and again in the thira oe
defeat St. Paul's of Garden City
by a score of 13-0, Both T, D,'s
were made on long runs by Dick
Gumerlock. The conversion was
made by Bill Driscoll.

In the first part of the first
period, Ken Strong of St. Paul's
was forced to kick on fourth down;
Dick Gumerlock took the ball on
St. Paul's 45 yard line and ran
the remaining distance for the
touchdown. Bill Driscoll's conver-
sion, however, was blocked.

In the third period, Prep again
started to move. On four plays
they brought the ball from their
own 47 to the St. Paul's 31, Dill
and Waldman carrying. Gumerlock
raced the rest of the way for a Te
De Driscoll kicked the point.

The last part of the game was
played in St. Paul's territory.

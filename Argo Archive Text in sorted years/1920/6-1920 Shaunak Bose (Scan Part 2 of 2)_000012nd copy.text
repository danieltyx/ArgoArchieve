The Cleanest RAW MILK is dangerous—all kinds of disease germs lurk in it
despite careful handling. Proper Pasteurization is the only absolute way in which
the danger can be removed. You secure a really Rich Pure Milk when you buy
our Pasteurized Milk—so why not stop taking chances and also obtain the best?

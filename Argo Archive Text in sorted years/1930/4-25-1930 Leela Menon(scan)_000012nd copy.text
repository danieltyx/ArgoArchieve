It is a. str that the
most beautiful of all qualities,
friendship, is so often  tmposed

upon and sneered at. We students
do that to a very great extent. We
make friends with an instructor, do
petty services for him, and try to
capttalize on—his friendship thus
sained to attain a passing grade.
The instructor hears such scraps of
conversation as this: “Oh, he won't
flunk me. I'm jake with him.” This
is true of those boys among us
who do the least possible amount

‘of work to get by, and who hope

because of friendship to get an
honor roll grade. We capitalize
upon it and use it merely as a

   

means to an end.

It ls true that friendship may be
& means to an end in certain cases,
but it should never be used as
such to the extent that a friend is
victimized or imposed upon.
We treat friendship as the rail-

TALKING AFTER BELLS

 

nh
A subject of concern to Rutgers

Prepsters, just now, jis thac of
talking after the bell rings for the
close of recess. Recently there has
been entirely too much of it, an
the faculty will be obli
drastic measures unless
immediate improvement,
Rules ure necessary wherever «
number of people are trying to get
along together, Society could not
exist without them. In any group,
there will always be some rules that
ure disagreeable to some people.
The point is not that we would
change such-and-such a rule if we
were in charge; the point Is that
the rule has been made by those in
charge, und to obey the rule is
therefore our duty
The obedience of
creating factor of good morale. Oc-
asionally a rule is made that is
unfair, but then the faculty {s al-
ways ready to modify it if asked in
@ proper mannerd, The obedience
of rules, usually, does not put us to
any great Inconvenlence; their dis-
obedience always destroys the
morale of the school, The great
majority of rules are fair and
right, and are made for the purpose
of avoiding the confusion that
would result without them. Dis-
obedience, even of a minor regula-
tion, invariably leads to an imme-
diate decrease in morale. Rule-
breaking is always a dangerous
matter, and only on extremely rare
occasions is it at all justifinble. The
rules that boys usually break are
of minor importance in themselves
and are broken mainly for the fun
of “putting one over” on the au-
thorities. This however, It must be

THE ARGO

 

 

 

 

 

We reproduce the following from
the D. U, S. Triangle (Detroit Uni-
versity School) of November, 1929:

 

ON BOOKS
Books are the bearers of knowl-
edge. Their effect is felt in the

farthest corners of the earth. They
vividly: recall the past. and mirror
the pr evana future in an Inter-
esting way. In former times books
were scarce. The common people
were ignorant and illiterate. Even
the nobles were obliged to hire
men to write their letters. The
priests were practically the only
people who could read and write.
Gradually books began to replace
the handwritten manuscripts. There
was more freedom of the press.
However, even in the eighteenth

 

 

‘century books were not plentiful in

the United States, There were no
novels or story books for children.
About the beginning of the nine-
teenth century children’s books be-
gan to come into their own. Prac-
teal Il the stories were designed

 

‘to teach a lesson or give a moral.

‘Today there are books in almost
every home in America, The time
worn story of the Kentucky moun-

taineer who when asked if he
would like a book for a present,
answered, “I have a book," ts no

longer true. Everyone has books,
Let us appreciate them, Books en-
tertain us, they broaden our view-
‘point, they present to us the

ages, Let us consider books as a
austible storehouse, open

lowing:

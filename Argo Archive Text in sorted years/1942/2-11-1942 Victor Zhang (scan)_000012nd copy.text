Students Decide To
Buy Defense Bonds

Each Boy to Contribute
Dime a Week; Fund
To Supply 1 Prizes

 

 

 

 

 

  

   

   

 

  

 

The student body of Rutgers Prep
in a meeting just before the Christmas
vacation voted in favor of a plan _pro-
viding for the purcha: of Defense
Saving Stamps. This plan went into
effect immediately on the resumption
of classes after the holidays, and will
continue until school closes in June.

Each person is pledged to give a
dime a week out of his own money to

 

 

 

pay for the stamps. With the full
support of the student body and the
faculty, it will be possible to accumu-

  

and

 

late enough of these to buy thre
a four Defense Saving Bonds.

The Defense Bonds will be used for
scholastic prizes and awards for classes
to come, The bonds, which will ma-
ture in ten years, will be known as
the Award of the Class of 1941-42 or
by some such name. Since these awards
will greatly help Rutgers Prep, this
plan deserves the complete cooperation
of the student body.

Willi ictal Hire, Class of 1940-1941
is now Petty Officer in the Coast
Guard, and has been transferred from
a post in Louisiana to Barnegat, N.

Lyman M. Evans, Class of 1938-39,

FATHER HUBBARD,
JESUIT PRIEST,
TALKS ON ALASKA

On the 18th of ‘of January, Father Hub-
bard, doughty Jesuit priest, gave a lec-
ture on Alaska at the Roosevelt Junior
High School on Livingston Avenue.
The afternoon lecture, Which your
“Argo” reporter attended, was slightly
toned down to the level of the children
who for the most part composed the
audience, but was nevertheless of great
interest.

At the beginning of the lecture,
ther Hubbard made a comment on
the disposition of the Japanese nation
which would seem to be of the greatest
importance. He said that the Japanese
have only one in purpose in life—to
win the respect of their descendents,
and to gain the approval of their an-
cestors, He also ¢ jaims that they have
no hope of winning the war, but are in
pe only for the aforesaid reason. How-

once in they will fight like
enone: because they have absolutely

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

   

 

no fear of death. Therefore, the wild
rumors of suicide bombings and tor-
pedoings that floating
around are very mos, for
tter are a branch of the same
who have migrated across the

 

Bering Straights and who have set-
tled on the North-Western shore of
our own continent. Also, the Eskimos
of today are much different from the
Eskimos of fiction and fancy. They
wear furs, yes, but every Eskimo has in
his house a Sears-Roebuck catalogue
from which he frequently makes pur-
chases. Ag he s uses a kyack
for his fishing trips, but on a_ long

 

 

 

 

 

 

voyage he  emplo: an outboard
motor. Also, many of the Eskimos

seen in the motion pictures which ac-
companied the lecture were smoking
cigarettes. But the greatest let down
of all is this—the Eskimons not only
do not use igloos, but very few have
ever heard of them. The native of
Alaska lives quite decently, consider-
ing the conditions he must cope with,

most of us, The shortening of the
school term by the shoving ahead of
mid-year examinations is probably the
most important of these. Also, gradua-

sometime around June fourth.

two-minute warning bells that woke

This will make for better use of those

The boarding school has found out
what one does during and previous to
an air aid warning. Although an at-
tack is improbable right now, the boys
at The Traps know what to do when
the alarm sounds. All the houses are
blacked out, and everyone gocs to the
cellar or to a similarly safe place dur-
ing the trial raid.

SECOND RUTGERS CONCERT FEATURES
PIANO TEAM OF FRAY AND BRAGGIOTTI

The duo-pianists, Fray and Braggi-
otti, who played i in Rutgers Gymnasium
on January 7, 1942, first met in a music
tare in Paris. Fray was playing a ce
n piece by George Gershwin,
Braucioat, in another studio, played
fragments from the “Rhapsody in Blue”
into Fray’s playing. Both suddenly
were aware of the excellent effect that
the two pianos gave. They rushed out
of their studios, congratulated each
other, and shook hands midway in the
hall. This began the partnership that
has now won praise throughout the
world.

Fray and Braggiotti_ were both stu-
dents of the French Conservatory of
Music and had strict background of
classical training. They were also sin-
cere admirers of such revolutionary
composers as George Gershwin, Stra

vinsky, Poulenc, and others.

Parisian banker, s mother liked the

EDWIN NELSON
JOINS UP WITH
COAST GUARD

The first member of the of the student body
of the Rutgers Preparatory School to
enlist in the service of the United
States was Edwin Nelson of High-
land Park, New Jersey. Edwin a
member of the school for the past
and a half, enlisted in the Coast
Guard, one of the vital cogs in the d
fense of the United States. His desti-
nation is yet unknown since he has
not received his definite stationing.

Edwin has been an active member
of the student body ever since he en-
tered Rutgers Prep. He has been an
important member of the football squad
for the past two seasons. Last spring
he was a member of the first crew in
Rutgers Prep history. An amiable fel-
low, Edwin has always had a large
circle of friends wherever he has gone.
Wherever he may go during the next

WAR HYSTERIA

One of the greatest dangers of this warlike age is the danger of war

hysteria, People have a tendency to get all worked up over the anti-
Axis propaganda which is circulated around the country, and there is
a great danger that this excitement may be carried to too great lengths,
important though it be. Something of this sort happened in the last
war, when any favorable reference to Germany was liable to incite
a nearby mob to lynching. Things got to such a state that a man was
much discredit on our great nation. It is not a sign of patriotism by
killed by a group of angry“patriots” merely because he had been
whistling “Ach Du Leiber Augustine” on the street. Courses in G
man were discontinued in most schools, and all German literature
was cut out of the curriculum.

This is a situation which is not only unfortunate, but which reflects
any means, but to the contrary, a most cowardly and ignoble action. If
one feels as strongly as that against our enemies, he should join the
army, not take it out on innocent civilians.

Another point to be considered is that of the German, Italian, and
Japanese immigrants who have come into this country to live. Most
of these are good loyal citizens—a great many have been driven from
their homeland by the very organizations we are now combating. Dur-
ing a certain period of the last war, it was “the thing” to heave bricks
and mud-pies at foreign-born people who lived in the vicinity.
Luckily, there has been no resumption of this disgraceful conduct up
until now, but there is always a danger of its reappearance, and one
should strive valiantly to stand aloof from such a base exhibition of
knavery.

 

 

 

      

   

   

 

 

A TRIBUTE TO THE DUTCH

In these days of war when we laud our military and naval heroe:
it seems only fair t we should extend a word of praise to those
fighting Dutch, who are currently making such a valiant defense of
their island possessions in the Pacific. Every day we hear reports of
Dutch successes in the East Indies. For several weeks the Dutch have
made a record of sinking at least one Japanese merchant ship or w:
ship per day. According to the Netherlands’ news agency there a
half dozen Japanese submarines and a large toll of the invading troops
and airplanes have been taken by the defendors of the strategic islands.

The importance of the Netherlands East Indies cannot be over-
estimated. The Indies are a long belt of islands extending for three
thousand miles between the southeastern tip of continental Asia and
the northern portion of Australia. It is on these main islands of
Borneo, Java, Sumatra, New Guinea, and Celebes with a population
of 60,000,000 people that the United States relies for 959 of its supply
of rubber. In addition the Indies have large supplies of sugar, petrol-
eum, and tin, all of which are invaluable to a nation at war.

Loss to the Japanese of these key islands would be a tremendous
blow to the United States. Besides reaping the rich natural benefits
of the islands, the Japanese would cut the British lifeline between the
I fic and Indian oceans and the soldiers of the Land of the Rising
Sun would have bases for attacks on Australia. If these Jap attacks
could be carried out successfully, then the Japanese would hold con-
trol of all American, Dutch, and British Possessions in the western
Pacific.

THE BOOKWORM

ORM
Random House by George Stewart
It is hard to decide whether Mr.
Stewart should have chosen teaching
as a career, as he did, or whether he
should have become a scientist, as he
might very well have done. For his

 

best-selling novel STORM contains
a tremendous amount of material, not
onl

on meteorology, but also on such
ly varied topics as road-patrolling,
wire-stringing, and navigation. The
author has obviously spent many hours
at the local library and on the road,
finding out for himself the data on his
subjects.

The story deals with the progress of
a storm—its inception, its growth, and
its final death; all told vividly and
easily, not only by description of the
tempest itself, but also by its effect on
the neighborhood. It is a most un-
usual plot and would seem to set a
new style in American literature.

One of the main characters of the

 
 
 

 

 

book a young meteorologist whose
whimsical habit it is to name new
storms as he finds them, and to

watch their progress across the world.
While some fizzle out immediately into
dull fogs, some become mild winds,
and some few develop into real
“whammeroos.” Maria, for so does he
call the storm whose progress we are
interested in makes its start in the
North Pacific at a time when all Cali-
fornia is in the midst of a drought and
desperately in need of water, and
from there works its way eastwards,
gradually increasing first sign of viol-
ence is a severe blowing that it gives

the mountains it turns to snow, and
blocks up all the passes of the Rocky
Mountains. But now it is merely a
matter of time until the storm ‘has
expended its force, for a certain period
completelly exhausts its powers and
leaves it harmless.

he storm itself is by no means the
most important part of the story, ex-
cept in an indirect manner, but rather
the high points are and the incidents
and their bearing upon one another.
For there seems to be an idea at the
back of the writers mind dealing with
the interdependence of one event on
another. In one early picture, for a
number of pictures carry the even
along, there is a log of wood on a truck.
A little later it falls on the road. Soon
some dirt falls onthe log of wood.
After this, nothing is mentioned about
either of these two items until a car
skids against the log in a dri ing rain
storm, crashes through a railing, and
falls down a precipice. Three seperate
events, therefore, are tied together
and interwoven. Near the start of the
book, an owl, sitting on an electric
wire, is electrocuted. Nobody sees it
happen—nobody knows. However, dur-
ing the storm the wire falls down, hav-
ing been slightly weakened and a
lineman dies trying to repair it. All
events scem to be related in one way
or another.

Newark Academy

Attack Defeats
Prep, 52 to 27

Red and Black’s Onslaught In

Middle Periods Overwhelms
nt Rutgers | Team

 

A surging Newark Academy attack,
which gained momentum in the s
ond and third periods, proved suffi.
cient to defeat Rutgers Prep, 52 to 27,
in the Maroon’s third start of the bas-
ketball season. The Prepsters, play-
ing on the Newark court, got off to a
good start in the nip-and-tuck first
period as Captain Phil Reugger put
one in from under the basket. Newark
tied it up on a goal by Len Tepper,
but Prep countered on_a doubledecker
by Danny Williams. The Newarkers
went into the lead, however, for the
first time on a field goal by Benny
Gulla and a foul by Tepper, but their
one-point lead was erased as Harry
Cohen netted a two-pointed and Prep
took the lead for the third time in the
period. The Red and Black surged to
the fore, 8 to 6, on a three-point clus-
ter as the period ended.

From then on out, Newark had the

game its own way. After Gulla had
scored a field goal, Milt Schottland
threw in seven successive points, and
the home team continued the mpage
to lead 23 to 9 at halftime. The third
period proved as much of a nightmare
to the visiting Maroon as Newark
scored seventeen more points largely
on field goals by Gulla and Tepper.
Prep accounted for seven points in
that period on doubledeckers by Reug-
ger and Williams and a foul by George
Mederer,

Prep made its best effort of the day
in the fourth period as they scored cle-
ven points on three ficld goals by Gus
Gustafson, two by Danny Williams,
and a foul by Cohen. Newark added
twelve more counts to their score in the
same period and the game ended, 52 to
27.

  

 

 

he Prepsters attack was lead by
Danny Wi s and Phil Renaeer
with eight points each and Gus
tafson with six. Schottland and Gulla
paced the winners with thirteen and
twelve points respectively. Coach Pet-
ke again used two teams and the fact
that there are ten men of almost equal
ability on the Prep squad will un-
doubtedly prove a great help in later
games. The Maroon team which lost
to Newark had as many capable play-
ers, but the age, experience, and height
of the home team’s first string were
the deciding factors in the game.

EXCHANGES

The “Jaques Bonhomme,” the French
paper at Pingry, has been again re-
vived to the great pleasure of those
who read it last year. Best luck to you,
“Jacques.”

In 1937 a teacher at California Prep
School notified the dance committee
that he would be unable to attend the
forthcoming formal prom because he
had no female acquaintance to take.
None-the-less the undaunted students
got a blind date for the empty-handed
teacher and, as a perfect ending to the
story, the couple were married this
September. This episode should set a
new ideal for our students who will
now give careful attention to all faculty
requests for blind dates.

 

 

Falling before an eight-point rally
in the closing minutes of play. Rut-
gers Vrep lost to Newman School,
26 to in the Maroon’s quest for
their second victory of the cage sea-
son.

The game was tightly played all the
way. Prep took a 4 to 1 lead in the
first quarter only to: be tied 10-10 at
the half. At the three-quarter mark.
Newman was in the van 17 to 14.
The Prepsters rallied to tie it up at
18-18 early in the final stanza before
Newman's final outburst decided the
contest.

The fine play of Gus Gustafson sent
Prep off to an carly lead in the first
quarter. Gus bagged a brace of field
goals while Newman, held scoreless
from the field was content with a
lone foul by Maxwell. The visitor's
strength began to show in the second
period as they rang up nine points to
knot the count at half time. Again
Gustafson, with three foul shots, paced
the Prepsters.

to 18. hweitzer countered with a
two-pointer moment later, but his
score was erased by Maxwell's field
goal. As the game ended Schweitzer
fale another spectacular long shot to
make the final score, 26 to 22.

The Prep attack was lead by Gus-
tafson with eight. Gus scored all his
points in the first half whereas Schwei-
tzer amassed his total in the final part
of the game. Newman was paced by
Maxwell with 12 points.

Prep was again bothered by the ad-
vantage of height which their oppo-
nents held over them. The Maroon
players showed great accuracy in
shooting from deep court, but it was
their inability to sink them from under
the basket that cost them the game.
On the other hand, Newman showed a
clean-working attack and deadly shoot-
ing from close up.

PINGRY IN SEASON
OPENER, 29-20

Rutgers Prep’s basketball team got
its cage season off to an_auspicious
start as it drubbed a good Pingry five,
29 to 20, on the losers’ court.

The Maroon’s first team experienced
little trouble in the initial period as it
blanked the Blue, 7 to 0, on two field
goals by Harry Cohen, one by George
Mederer and a foul by Dick Farkas.
As the second period started, Coach
Petke threw the second team into the
fray, and the reserves, although they
were unable to outscore their oppon-
ents, led at half time, 13 to 7.

The second half saw, both teams
come to life on the offensive. Prep
amassed sixteen points in the final part
of the game as Cohen and Mederer
each scored a brace of field goals and
Bishop and Ruegger Sddea single
doubledeckers. Cohen and Gustafson
sunk foul shots. Pingry accounted for
thirteen points in the second half as
high-scoring forward; George Wilmot
scored four field goals, and Knox ad-
ded two more. The game ended, 29 to
20, as Prep rallied in the closing min-
utes to ward off a Pingry rally, which
had cut the Marroon’s lead.

The Prep scoring was lead by Harry
Cohen who sunk four field goals for
eight points. George Mederer tallied
seven points and Dick Farkas and
Tommy hop added four apiece. Wil-
mot amassed 11 points to account for
more than half of Pingry’s total. Knox
scored four counters for the losing Blue
combine, The Prep quintet was far
more well-balanced than their oppo-
ments whose attack centering around a
single man, failed to click at certain
times.

the house to see if all the lights are

The Alpha House used a different
system from the Delta House in that
the air-raid warden pulled the master-

house into complete blackness.

Mr. Shepard who watched the whole
procedure said, “There were a few
flaws in the alarm; namely, the lights
remained on in the serving-pantry and
in the cellar of the Beta House. Other
than that the raid was a success.”
Though no one was advised of the
alarm, it came off with a minimum of
time, showing the efficiency of the stu-

The Varsity basketba
neyed to Montclair on Friday, January
17, to battle the Montelai
courtsters. After a hard-! fought and
bitterly-contested game in Montclair's
small gymnasium, the home team pre-
yailed, 41 to 28.
Soon atter the opening whistle, Bob
Ehner started the ball rolling for Mont-
clair. He neatly dropped the ball
through the hoop from mid-court and
was, at the same time, fouled. He sank
the foul and Montclair led 3 to 0. When
the Prep starting five failed to score,
Coach Petke sent in his other team. and
Al Evans Sromptly: ieeped one in from
beneath the basket. Th rst quarter
continued evenly, Monte r having a
three-point edge as the period ended.
As the second quarter opened, Bill
Wurzberger chalked up a foul. A few
seconds later, Jim Connell netted two
points from under the basket for Mont-
clair, At this juncture, the starting
team returned to the game for Prep.
The teams battled scorelessly for sev-
eral minutes beiore George Mederer
scored on a beautiful long shot from
mid-court. This was Jim Connell’s
period, however, for twice more before
the half ended, he dropped the ball
through the hoop. As the first half
came to an end, Montclair led, 15 to 9.
The first score of the second half
was made by Ehner on a break-away
play. Harry Cohen scored next on a
foul shot for Montclair, and this was
followed almost immediately by an
identical shot by Phil Ruegger for
Prep. Ehner, Delhagen and Connell
then went on a spr each scoring a

Bishop made two foul shots good, and
the period ended as Emerson sank a
shot from the middle of the floor.
Bill Parker started off the last quar-
ter by sinking two in a row for Mont-

quarter was done on foul shots, though
George Mederer did loop a ball in from
under the basket. nerson dropped in
the final shot of the game and made the

Never before had we realized how
great a part the weather bureau plays
in the attairs of the day. It is the med-
mium between nation and nature. If the
weather man predicts rain and it is a
sunny day, the greater part of the popu-
lation will sweat and groan under a
load of rubbers, umbrellas, an
coats. On the other hand, an ex
calm day that turns into a rain is
equally disastrous. Almost everyone
will get wet. Some people having con-
tracted pneumonia from being chilled
will dic. Others will go out in boats
which will capsize in the unforseen
downpour. Liners caught unprepared,
will be almost swamped. And all from
the mistake of saying “fair” instead of
“rain!”

“Storm” is one of the most unusual
and the unexpected books of the year.
It represents an entirely new technique
in writing, and one that gives promise
for the future. If his other are to be as
interesting as this book, let us hope
that Mr. Stewart keeps on writing for
a long time.

One of the films dealt with an island
(of unpronounceable name) which has
the annoying habit of intermittently
appearing and disappearing! This
strange phenomenon is caused by vol-
canic disturbances far in the earth,
which keep building up the island's size
until one day they explode. When this
occurs, the island disappears and the
process starts over again.

One of Father Hubbard's greatest
discoveries concerns the formation of
icebergs. The popular notion has been

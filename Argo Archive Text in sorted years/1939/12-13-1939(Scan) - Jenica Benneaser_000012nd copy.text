Honor Roll For
November Shows
Slight Increase

Beardslee and J. M. Wells Lead Total |

of Nineteen. Twelve Hon-
orable Mentions

The honor roll at the Rutgers Pre-
paratory School for the month ending
November 17, 1939, was announced by
Mr. Shepard, headmaster of the school,
on November 28. There were nineteen
boys on the honor roll, which number
is twenty-one per cent of the total
student body. This shows an increase
of three boys over last month's honor
roll. The Senior Class placed nine boys
on the honor roll; the Junior Class,

three; the Sophomore Class, five; the
Freshman Class, two.
Mr. Shepard stated that he was

pleased with the work of the boys dur-
ing this, the second month of the school
year, although he said that he was
somewhat disappointed at the work of
some of the boys. Mr. Shepard said
that it seemed as though those boys
who did excellent work last month did
even better this month, and in contras

  

 

those boys who did fair work  las'
eemonth did rer work this month. —

 

The honorable mention ruling was
again explained by Mr. Shepard as fol-
lows: “A student must attain an aver-
f cighty per cent or better in his
work for the month, and he must
have a certifying grade of sevent:
percent or better in each course in order
that his name may be placed on the |
honor roll for the month. Honorable
mention is to be awarded to those stu-
dents, who obtain an average of eighty
per cent or better in all their subjects,
but who failed to attain a certifying
grade in one or more subjects.

There were twelve boys receiving
honorable mention, a decrease of seven
boys as compared to last month's honor
roll

| The second of the Rutgers Concert
series at the University Gymnasium
| was held on Monday evening, Novem-

prano, and Mr. Ezio Pinza, bass, gave
| a joint recital in a program consistin
of selections from the works of Mozart,

of nineteen at Dresden, and in the
following years toured Eurers. singing
in all the large cities. In 1923 Mme.
Rethberg made her debut at the Metro-
politan Opera House, New York, and
since then has become an American

Bologna, making his debut in Rome in
1919. Shortly thereafter he came to
America and made his debut in New
York. Since then he has been recog-
nized as one of America’s great singers.

Wm. Lyon Phelps |
Preaches Sunday
Chapel Sermon

Dr. William Lyon Phelps, Professor
Emeritus of Yale University, was the
very welcome speaker at Kirkpatrick
Chapel, Sunday, December 10.

As a text for his sermon Dr. Phelps |
chose the 13th chapter of I Corinthians
and the 5th chapter of the Gospel ac-
which is more |
geerally known as the Sermon on the
Mount. Dr. Phelps said that Jesus |
spoke not to the multitude but to those |
who chose to follow him. Therefore |
He went up into the mountains and his
disciples gathered around him. Dr.
Phelps saterpreted the Sermon on the |
Mount as being the best way of life
Mercy and Charity, he said, were the
main points. Without these things a |
man could not have peace and tran- |
quility of mind and the ability to con-
quer life.

Mozart Aria Opens Concert

Mr, Pinza opened the concert with an
aria from The Magte Flute by Mozart. In
this, Sarastro, the High Priest of the
Temple of Isis, tells Pamina, a novice,
that within the walls of the temple there
are no thoughts of enmity or vengeful-
ness. O Bellissini Capelli, a passionate love
song, and Che Fiero Costume followed.

There were two encores after t
group, one of which was a lively and
humorous air from Mozart's Don Gio-
ann, telling of the troubles that Le-
porello, a valet, has with his master.

Mme. Rethberg and Mr. Pinza next
rendered a duet, also from Don Giovanni,
in which the Don makes advances to
the pretty coquette, Zerlina, who_ is
about to be married to a peasant. She
makes small show of resistance.

German Songs Follow Intermission

After the intermission, Mme. Reth-
berg sang two rather heavy composi-
tions of Franz and Brahms. The first

Close Balloting, Among Six Nominees
Gives Harper The
Presidency

The members of the Rutgers Pre-
paratory School student body assembled
on November 28 for the purpose of
electing the school’s student officers.
Held after the morning recess, the as-
sembly was thus convened in order to
insure as complete a representation in
the voting as was possible. Mr. Shepard
conducted the meeting and received
nominations for the election of the
president and vice-president. When the
returns of the election were ade
known two days later, it was found
that William Harper had received a
majority of the ballots cast. After the
announcement of the results, Bill made
a short speech and assumed the office

 

 

Since he had received the
largest number of votes cast,
Searle was automatically
president of the school. At the same
time at which he made the announce
ment of these results, Mr. Shepard re-

made vice-

position of Secretary. The students
were informed on the following day
that Anthony Gosse had been elected

to that office.
Harper Has Long School Record

Having graduated from the Rutgers
Elementary School, Bill Harper is now
completing his fifth y at the Prep
school. During his years at Prep Bill,
by his fun-loving spirit. and general
geniality, has made himself the most
popular boy in the school. While still
in_ his Sophomore and Junior years,
Bill was elected to. the office of Secre-
tary two consecutive times. He is a
resident of New Brunswick and conse-
quently has a large circle of friends out-
side of the Preparatory school.

On the athletic side Bill has shown
himself to be a most valuable basketball
player. He has been a member of two
varsity basketball championship teams,
and his abiliti a first-sacker on the
diamond are well known. Under the
able coaching of Mr. Rudy, Bill has de-
veloped into one of the best centers
seen around Prep’s basketball court in
many rs. Upon his graduation this
spring, Bill entertains hopes of going
to Duke University. We know that
Bill's friendly manner will make many
a friend for him down in that genial
college town.

A NEW WINTER SCHEDULE

A new plan for conducting school during the winter term is at
present being considered by Mr. Shepard and the faculty. ‘This term
's the most trying for both’ students and masters, in that classes tend
to become tedious; there is a general laxness of work; and there is a
strain on the good disposition of everyone. Therefore, in an effort
to shorten the winter term and at the same time give a longer Easter
vacation to the students and faculty, this plan has been proposed, In-
stead of going to school for eleven weeks between Christmas and
Easter, it has been suggested that school be held on Saturday morn-
ings in order that the winter term may be cut to nine weeks. The
advantages of this plan are that, although the required number of
school days will be observed, nevertheless everyone will receive a
longer vacation and be in better condition to meet the final spring term.
However, to gain these advantages certain sacrifices must be made.
Because of Saturday classes, Friday evening will of necessity be no
longer free but dedicated to study. This will most affect the board-
ing department who re ularly go home over the week-ends. Theirs
would perhaps be the greatest sacrifice.

This new plan has not been definitely decided upon, since permis-
sion to use the recitation building on Saturday morning must first be
gained from the University, but it is being considered with the benefit
of the student body and faculty in mind.

  

 

 

  

EXCUSES

It is plausible, though hardly probable, that in the y' to come
people may read in magazines advertisements informing anyone con-
cerned that methods had been discovered which guaranteed immunity
to “excuseosis”, provided that one adhered strictly to the rules of the
cure. We sincerely hope, however, that excuse-making will not have
become so widespread an evil in future days that cures will have to be
invented for it.

The class-room and the athletic field are where excuses are made
commonplace by their continued use. It is in these places that one
establishes a reputation as to whether he is an habitual excuse-maker.
If he is, the fault may or may not lie entirely in the individual.

For instance, during the course of some athletic practice an im-
patient coach may sharply reprimand a greenhorn for some apparently
silly error. When it is demanded of the player why he did not do the
correct thing, he is automatically put on the spot. If he remains silent,
the coach either will think that he is extremely stupid or plainly dis-
courteous. In either case the individual is usually too confused by
his own error to give a logical reason, if there is one, as to why he
did not do what he should have done. As a result of his own befuddle-
ment and embarrassment, he makes some lame alibi to the coach who
promptly tabs the player and his abilities as being very inferior.

In the classroom excuses seem no less than ntial elements in
the every day routine. Excuses are offered to teachers which cover
many phases of school life, and the large majority of these excuses are
justifiable in most cases. Some students, however, are inclined to pre-
sent to teachers such haphazard reasons for various short-comings
that it is amazing to see that the students themselves possibly hope
that the teacher will accept the excuse.

Although excuses are sometimes necessary, they should not be
overworked. One should attempt zealously to avoid excuse-making,
and this can be done only by trying to the best of one’s ability to per-
form the daily tasks to which he is assigned. By doing this, one rea-
son motivating excuse-making, namely, that of lack of preparation,
will, for the most part, be eliminated,

CAPTAIN HORATIO. HORNBLOWER
by C. S. Forester. Little, Brown and Company.
1939,

His Majesty's ship Lydia was seven
months out of England without having
touched a single port since its depart-
ure. The boat, commanded by Captain
Horatio Hornblower, was sailing some
where in the Pacific in the closing years
of the eighteenth century with its des
tination unknown to everyone except
the Captain.

Hornblower was young for a captain
in the British Navy, He differed from
most of the British Naval commanders
in that he treated his crew with respect
and kindness, but was firm and harsh
when he had to be. Hornblower hated
flogging or any means of corporal pun-
ishment and did away with it when-
ever he could. The crew admired and
perhaps loved their captain because he

WHAT-NOTS

by Roy Stogner

 

 

 

With the prospect of a two-weeks'
vacation looming up before us like a
heacon in the wilderness, joviality prac-
tically runs rampant among the studes
at Prep. This spirit of good-feeling
and brotherly love which Christmas
promotes has asserted itself with the
utmost prominence. Why it was only
the other day that we observed one in-
dividual apologizing to another for hav-
ing owed that two bucks he'd borrowed
a few months hence for so long a time.
His FHA loan, he explained, had been
held up. (Don't blame me for that one,
fellows, | only print the news as
interpret it).

And speaking of the FHA, Roland
Leon might be interested in further
particulars if he seriously
spend his summer vacations in
States.

\ plaintive complaint uttered by the
comedian Bert Lahr after a slight earth-
quake was: “My house is so shaky from
these earthquakes that everytime a car
rolls by outside, the termites have to
jom hands to keep the building from
falling down.” We imagine that if the
termites in the Orient exhibit the same
community spirit as is evidenced in Mr.
Lahr's house, they are probably so
fagged out most of the time that they
have little spare time to spend in add-
ing to the earthquake's results in their
own quaint little way.

Some innocent was heard inquiring
as to whether “Perey” Harper was
really connected with the mule trade.
Upon investigating we found that the
little one's distortion of the situation
had merely resulted from his having
heard someone call “Perce” a black-
smith, To put everyone's mind at ease
we'd like to say that Harp isn't en-
gaged in that once lucrative occupation.

lieve, be traced right back to the Chem

Coach Gives Views
On Football Team

Mr. Petke and ARGO Reviewer
Find Inexperience The
Cause of Defeats

The Rutgers Preparatory School
brought to a close their none too suc-
cessful football season by losing to the
George School of Newtown, Pa. on
Saturday, November I.

The Prep team, consisting of thirty-
one boys, both day and boarding stu-
dents, was a team inexperienced in the
ways of the gridiron. A majority of
them had never donned a football uni-
foim before, Mr. Petke and Mr. Holley
trained these boys in the fundamentals
of football.

In the opening game of the season
against the Morristown School, the
Prepsters tasted their first defeat, then,
practising hard and diligently during
the next week, came out full of spirit
and intent upon defeating their next
rival, The Newman School of Lake-
wood, and after four quarters of hard
football emerged with a score of 0-0,
Had the quarters been the regulation
time of twelve minutes, the Maroon
and White might have come out vic-
torious, but in order that the game be
played without the aid of floodlights,
the quarters were reduced to nine min-
utes each. Statistics of the game showed
that the Prepsters had had the edge
over their opponents. The Montclair
Academy was the second setback of the
Rutgers squad, who lost to their more
experienced rivals 19-0. In the final
game of the season Rutgers Prep lost
20-0,

Geipel filled the guard slots. Bob
Hanna, All-State center from Roselle
Park, injured in the last l
tice, gave up his post to Johnny Bishop,
who proved himself to be a great ball
passer-back. Little Dave Rust, a sopho-
more at Prep, proved that he was a
ball-carrier extraordinary and therefore
was moved up to fullback on the first
team, Gabriel Hausner, quarterback,
was the sparkplug of the team in every
encounter, running the ball through the
line and tackling hard, and thereby
proved himself an asset to the Prep
team. The halfback positions were
filled by Roy Stogner, Casper Deschu,
Chandler Thompson, Harold Johnson,
Jack Coad, Mat Gutkowski, and
Johnny Hackett. The kicking depart-
ment was handled by Al Updike, Bob
Hanna and Jim Wells. Both Hanna
and Updike were put out of action be-
cause of the injuries they received in
the games and in practice. Others re-
ceiving injuries during the season were
Roy Stogner, Dave Matthews, Casper
Johnny Hackett and Chand-
ler Thompson. The Managerial staff
consisted of Bob O'Donnell, Bob
Becker and Jim Stapleton, who were
always on the job supplying the play-
ers with whatever they neede

| Basketball Squad
Off To Good Year
As Drills Start

‘The Rutgers Prep basketball team
has begun training at the Prep School
gymnasium, The squad is being coached
by Mr. Harry E. Rudy who ts now i
his fifth season as basketball coach of
Rutgers Prep.

The school teams have been highly
successful in the past five years, and in
1937 and 1938 won the State Champion-
ship. The two previous years the team
reached the finals of the State Tourna-
ment only to be defeated. Last year’s
squad was undefeated in its class, and
as no State Championship was held for
Group [IL Prep schools, Rutgers Prep
is virtually still the defending champion.
This year's team is determined to up-
hold the fine record made by the Rut-
gers Toe teams in the past and to re-
tain the State Championship.

Xluey, Kolakowski, Schmidt, Pen-
nington and Hasbrouck have graduated
and leave only Bill Harper for the lone
veteran. Harper, a rangy center, was
a member of the 1938 championship
team and of last year’s mythical cham-
pionship team.

OF the seventeen boys who tried out
for the squad, eleven are left. The play-
ers are as follows: Casper Deschu,
Harvey Miller, Dave Matthews, Dick
Meyers, Bob Morrison, Bill Harper,
Harvey Moynihan, Jim Wells, Bob
Hanna, Al Updike and John Hackett.
John Bishop is managing this year's
team.

Mr. Rudy has expressed great confi-
dence in the potential abilities of this
year's squad, small though it may be,
and, early in practice has concentrated
on developing the speed and endurance
of the players as a whole. Even at this
early date, tthe team spirit of past years
which has been a part of championship
squads is found again among the eleven
who represent the school in basketball.
Rutgers Prep faces a long and hard
schedule with high hopes of bringing
another trophy to the school.

 

 

Juniors Vindicate
Varsity Loss With

Montclair Victory

Phil Rust, Jim Potter and Bob
Cramer paced the local “Prepsters” to
a 27 to 0 victory over the Montclair
Midgets in a game featured by spec-
tacular runs and passes. This was the
second win for the Rutgers boys after
one setback and two scoreless ties.

Francis Johnson, Prep halfback, re-
turned the opening kickoff to the fifty
yard stripe. Two line bucks by John-
son and a pass, Potter to Joe Cramer,
netted only seven yards, and Potter
punted to Bartsch on the Montclair
twenty yard line. Northrup, Montclair
quarterback, dropped back and heaved
an aerial intended for Crosby, but Pot-
ter intercepted the pigskin and ran it
back to the Montelair twenty-five. Phil
Rust took the ball on a reverse and
skirted left end for the first score of
the game. Bob Cramer tallied the
extra point with a center plunge.

Late in the second quarter, after a
march of fifty yards, Jim Potter
wormed his way through tackle for
ten yards and the second score. Cramer
again made the point and the half ended
with Rutgers in front by fourteen
points,

The third touchdown came early in
the last period after a sustained march
of forty yards climaxed by a_ thirty
yard run off tackle by Rust. In the
closing minutes of the game, Rust got
loose again and ran twenty yards for
the final score, with Cramer adding the
extra point on a line plunge.

Loses Last Game
To George School

Two Touchdowns In Each Half
Swamp Home Team On
Homecoming Day

 

The Rutgers Prep football team
closed its season before a crowd of a
hundred parents and friends at Neilson
i 11, when a much heavier
1 eleven ran roughshod to
tory. Two touchdowns in
the second and last periods accounted
for the scoring

A break early in the first period gave
the Rutgers boys the pigskin on the
visitor's twenty-five yard line, but three
line plays with Hausner, Rust and
Deschu carrying the ball netted only
eight yards, and George School took
the ball on downs.

In the second quarter the Pennsyl-
vania lads started a march from their
own forty-five which ended in a score
Running plays with Cadwallader and
Green toting the ball, mixed with a
few passes, took the ball to the Rutgers
thirty-two. Harry Hummell skirted
left end for sixteen yards and a first
down. Two line plays with Hummell
running the ball gained only five yards,
and Stan Green faded and threw a pass
to Cadwallader who stepped over the
goal line for the first score. Johnny
Campbell's placement was good.

The second score came later in the
same period when another aerial found
the arms of Cadwallader. Two passes,
Campbell to Hummell, were good for
fourteen yards and set the stage for
the touchdown.

Second Half More Evenly Matched

Phe third quarter was evenly
matched, with Prep having a slight ad-
vantage. Fumbles were very costly,
halting any marches that got under way.

The George School players stepped
on the gas in the final frame and pushed
over two more scores to sew up the

“Cyrano” At Madison

Che following Friday evening, De-

group, supervised by ‘Mr

Christie, Cleve Backster, Leonard

This play is a romantic comedy, set
in Seventeenth Century ce, that
gay period so vividly depicted by Alex-
ander Dumas, and deals with the love,
the renunciation, and brilliant’ wit of
the swashbuckling hero Cyrano. It was
a creditable performance for amateurs,
and the costumes and stage settings
made an appropriate background. for

is autumn, and all seems sad and dreary,
for she has lost her lover. The second
was a love song, telling the Zephyrs to
carry a message to the loved one.

The selections which followed pro-
vided a contrast, being light composi-
tions by Wolf, one a love song, the
other about an elf who, waking up at
night, sees some glowworms and be-
es them lights from a wedding.
Mr. Pinza returned to give another
group of songs, including a charming
lullaby, Fiocea La Neve, and two arias
which showed his magnificent voice to
good advantage. The concert ended
with the beautiful Swallow Duet from
Mignon, sung by both artists, who were
then called upon to deliver many en-

was the duet from The Marnage of Figaro.

During the first part of the concert
Mme. Rethberg appeared to be in rather

by nervousness and unsure delivery,

refused to let any member of his crew
do anything that he himself wouldn't
attempt. The thing that made him such
a successful commander (besides the
cooperation of his crew) was his brain
which worked like a delicate machine,
calculating nautical problems with in-
genious rapidity. Hornblower was the
type of man that women loved easily

he Lydia, a frigate of thirty: guns
was the only English boat stationed
in Paci waters during a Spanish dis-
pute. The reason for its being there
was to keep an eye on British posses-
sions and keep the Spanish towns along
the coast of the Americas fearful of
British supremacy. Hornblower piloted
his ship to a port in Central America
where provisions and fresh water were
taken on board. At sea once again the
Lyd encountered the Naterdad, a Span-
ish gunboat of two decks and twice her
force. Because of a superior commander
and a well-trained crew the British
handily sunk the bigger ship in a short
skirmish,

Putting in at Panama for more sup-
plies and dispatches from the homeland,
Hornblower discovers that peace with
Spain had been procured during his
campaign and that the orders are to re-
turn to England at once. On the return
voyage, the Lyduw meets a larger boat
flying the pirate flag. By clever man-
oeuvering on the part of Hornblower
and the mach ke working of the
crew, the enemy ship is sunk.

After a short leave of absence, Horn-
blower was put in command of a much
larger boat with twice the crew, and
sent in as a ship of the line to patrol the
Mediterranean Sea in order to help the
Spanish against the scourge of the
peror Napoleon's privateers. Hot
blower had nothing but contempt for
the French as seamen because of their
lack of good commanders and their ill-
fed, untrained, and undisciplined crews.
In one tussle off Toulon he captured a
French ship, hardly firing a shot. For
days he kept the French coats towns in
constant fear, striking unexpectedly at
various vulnerable spots. With the help
of several Spanish regiments Horn-
blower led a shore attack on a captured
town. In the furious counter-attack by

Napoleon's forces he was almost killed,
saved only by an alert midshipman.

While patrolling the Gulf of Rosas
alone, four French ships of the line en-
gaged him in a battle which raged for
several hours, Hornblower’s crew,
worhing superbly under fire, disabled
three of the enemy sh ut

order to keep from being entirely
hilated, Hornblower surrendered

After spending only two weeks in
prison, he an ush are sent for by
Napoleon to be questioned and then—
execution? On the trip to Paris, Horn-
blower, Brown who was brought along
as a servant, and Bush escaped after
knocking out their guard. They find a

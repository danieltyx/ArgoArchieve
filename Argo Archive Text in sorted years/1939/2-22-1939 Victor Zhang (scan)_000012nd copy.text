School Closes
For Two Days

Grippe Epidemic Rages

The epidemic of flu which has been
sweeping the eastern part of the country
and disrupting school and business took
hold of this school and caused an un-
expected but, might we say, welcome vaca-
tion, The only drawback is that the
two days during which school was sus-
pended, Thursday and Friday,
ninth and tenth respectively, wil
up by holding classes on Good Friday and
the first day of spring vacation, March
24. This period was not so much a vaca-
tion as a i, as Mr, Shepard said in
announcing it, to clear up all cases which
sted at the time and to take measures
to prevent any further outbreak. Movies
were prohibited, as were any other recrea-
tions which necessitated being in a crowd

The decision to suspend classes was
reached by Mr. Shepard and the college

physician when an alarming number of
cases of flu decreased the size of many
of the classes. In the boarding school
there were registered nine cases, not
including the two masters, Mr. Rudy and
Mr. Holley, who were unable to meet their

juring the inning of the week.

Basketball was hit hard, as Mr. Rudy
was ill for two games. Mr. Holley took
over the duties of coach for the Montclair
game, but was unable, because of his at-
tack, to go to Lawrenceville, so the next
substitute coach was Mr. Petke. The game
which was scheduled for January 28 with
Morristown was called off because three
members of the Morristown team and
their coach were in bed with the same
affliction.

However, we hope that because this
preventive measure was taken the school
year will finish with no further such steps
necessary.

 

 

Boston Symphony
Plays at Rutgers

 

On Tuesday, February 7, the Boston
Symphony Orchestra gave a concert in the
Rutgers Gymnasium, the third concert of
the current Rutgers season. Unfortunate-
ly, the regular conductor, the famed Dr.
Serge Koussevitzky, was unable to con-
duct, having been taken ill that after-
noon. The associate conductor, Mr. Bur-
gin, therefore, took over.

The first number played by the orches-
tra was Symphony Number 102, by Franz
Josef Haydn, the best known orchestral
work of that composer. This was very ap-
propriate, as this year marks the two
hundredth anniversary of Haydn's birth.

“La Mer,” a tone poem by Claude
Debussy, the modern impressionist com-
poser, was the next offering. This provided
a sharp contrast with the classical work
which preceded it. The program was con-
cluded with the great Fourth Symphony
of Johannes Brahms.

The performance was enthusiastically
received by a large audience. The concert
definitely showed the ability of the great
orchestra to rise triumphantly to an em-
ergency.

FEBRUARY

Midyear Honor
Roll Announced

Scholarship Pins Awarded

 

The marks for the half-year were issued
on Tuesday, February 14, during a meet-
ing of the student body, Mr. Shepard pre-
sented a total of twenty-one scholarship
pins to those boys whose averages for the
first term were above eighty.

Every student who had an average of
from eighty to eighty-five received a
bronze scholarship pin. To those boys
whose averages were from eighty-five to
ninety there was given a silver scholarship
pin. ‘There were only three boys in school
who had averages that were above ninety.
These boys received gold scholarship pins.

A comparison with the mid-term grades
of last year shows that this year’s marks
are decidedly higher, In 1938 there were
were only seventeen boys whose averages
were above eighty.

Mr. Shepard extended his congratula-
tions to the boys and expressed his grati-
fication that throughout the first term ap-
proximately one-quarter of the school had
been on the honor roll.

Dance Postponed
Until April

The dance committee has announced
that the dance scheduled for March has
been again postponed due to conflicting
dates. The semi-finals of the State bas-
ketball tournament will be held on March
10 and, because it is hoped that our team
will be in the semi-finals, it was thought
wise to choose another date for the dance
so that the students will be able to turn
out in a body to witness the game.

Spring vacation and another dance in
town interfere with the remaining Friday
nights in March, so that the dance will in
all probability be held early in April. As
soon as a definite date is determined it
will be announced.

The orchestra has not been picked, as
yet, but among the bids received the most
ikely choice will be either Jimmy Martin,
of Plainfield, or Ten Gilbert, who played
at one of last year’s dances and hails
from Highland Park.

It is hoped that arrangements can be
made to quarter girls in one of the dormi-
tories as has been done in previous years.
The bids have always sold for two dol-
lars a couple, but the committee has
stated that the price will be lowered if a
satisfactory turnout is assured. It will,
therefore, be for the best interests of
everyone if each of the students act as
salesmen and sees that his friends sign up.

Rutgers Prep
Bequeathed $5,000
By G. VanW. Voorhees

Late Alumnus’ Will Made Public

On February 9, when the will of Dr.
George Van Wickle Voorhees was pro-
bated in the Surrogate Court of Somerville
it was learned that Rutgers Preparatory
School had been left the sum of five thou-
sand dollars by its former alumnus, who
died in Somerville, January 29, 1939. The
estate of $35,000 was left in trust for
his mother, his brother, and his divorced
wife, and upon their death, the school will
receive the money. Other institutions to
receive bequests are the Pi Chapter of Xi
Psi Fraternity, the University of Penn-
sylvania, the New Jersey Sons of the
American Revolution, and the New Jer-
sey Society of Colonial Wars.

Dr. Voorhees attended the Prep from
1887 to 1892, After traveling for two
years. he returned to Prep and again was a
student from 1 to 1895, graduating
with the Class of 1895. Dr. Voorhees then
entered the University of Pennsylvania to
study dentistry, and graduated with the
Class of 1902, During the Great War Dr.
Voorhees joined the Second Infantry of
New Jersey, of which he was Captain,
F ought "until the Armistice. After

 

  

   

peace was declared he returned to New
Jersey, and set up practice as a dentist in
Somerville, where he resided until his
death at 108 Mountain Street. He was the
son of A. Craig Voorhees, and a rela-
tion of the Voorhees who gave the chapel
to the New Jersey College for Women,
which bears the name of Voorhees Chape!.
At this date it is impossible to say
what use will be made of the sum, but it
is supposed that the money will be used
to provide scholarships, and to make im-
provements in the dormitory buildings.
The school is very grateful for this tidy
sum, and appreciates greatly the loyalty
and thoughtfulness of this alumnus of

both the Elementary and Preparatory
Schools.

 

 

 

Former Rutgers
President Gives Sermon

When it was learned that, because of
illness, Prof. William Lyon Phelps, pro-
fessor emeritus at Yale University, would
not be able to speak as scheduled at Kirk-
Chapel, Dr. Thomas, who pre-
led President Clothier as head of Rut-
gers University, gladly stepped in to fill
the breach, and delivered a fine address
at the morning service, Sunday, Febru-
ary 19,

Dr. Thomas chose for his text St. Paul’s
words from the Epistle to the Galatians
(2:20) : “I have been crucified with Jesus,
nevertheless I live.” He read at Jength
from the Epistle, and spoke of the great
love and faith to be found therein, From
the book of Acts, he told the story of the
conversion of Saul on the road to Damas-
cus to stone St. Stephen, and demonstrated
how it changed a hard-hearted person
into a Christ-loving man, filled with all
the virtues of Christ, and endowed with a
tremendous energy and capacity for win-
ning people's confidence.

Dr. Thomas stated that he was making
no attempt to preach what he called a
“modern” sermon, one which would jus-
tify the lawlessness and lack of religion
in the present world by some Biblical or
moral precept. Rather he preferred to con-
form with the more old-fashioned pulpit
style.

Enforced Holiday
Enlivened by Trips

Lakehurst and Chemical Factory
Visited by Prep Boys

 

During the recent vacation when most
of the boarding students were at home,
due to the epidemic of influenza and
grippe, only mine boys remained on the
campus. In order to make the time pass
more quickly for these boys, Mr. Shepard
arranged two trips on Thursday and Fri-
day, February 9 and 10. “

The first trip was to the Naval Air
Base at Lakehurst, N. J., where is kept
all American lighter-than-air craft. There
was a large assortment of balloons and
blimps and also one dirigible, the Los An-
geles. Two groups of boys left the school,
one under the guidance of Mr. Ralls, the
other escorted by Mr. McClintock’ and
Mr. Petke. The latter group arrived first
and immediately began the tour of inspec-
tion. The second and larger group was
conducted around the buildings by Mr.
Bishop, a warrant officer stationed at
Lakehurst. He took this group over the
smaller hangar first. This “smaller”

angar was large enough to contain the

whole Prep School, with room left over
for the tennis courts. In it there were
two blimps, one in the process of being
dismantled ‘and the other rebuilt. There
was also an uninflated balloon there.
Coming over to the big shed, where
the Los Angeles was housed, we saw the
third largest airship hangar in the world.

Inside it, even the Los Angeles looked

small. Beside this dirigible, the technical

name for any lighter-than-air craft with

a rigid frame in which the gas bags are
suspended, were two blimps, which are
tnerely sausage shaped balloons. Later in
the day we were to see the sister blimps
oi these two make a Janding. The officer
with us explained how they were repairing
the Los Angeles, and, by climbing around
on ladders, we were able to see some of
its insides.

Most of the questions directed at Mr.
Bishop centered around the Hindenburg
disaster. He had been an cye witness of
that catastrophe, and had also seen the ship
at Lakehurst on many previous occasions.
He told us that, big as the hangar was,
the Hindenburg completely filled it and
required careful management to get it
inside,

Mr. Ralls’ party left about 1:30 P. M.,
with all the lunches aboard. It seems,
due to a misunderstanding, that Mr. Mac
and Mr. Petke, with their group, had left
too early and, as a consequence, missed
their lunch, since they could not be found.

Returning to Lakehurst at 3:30 P. M.
we arrived just as the first blimp was
landing. It turned into the wind and
moved slowly toward the mooring mast.
This was a tripod affair with a telescope
mast; the whole machine mounted on a
large, four-wheeled base and motivated by
a tractor, The ground crew grasped the
trailing cables and pulled the blimp into
the hangar. This procedure was repeated
with the other blimps, until all the air-
ships were tucked away for the night.

On Friday, the boys were taken on a
tour of the Calco Chemical Co., in Bound
Brook. Here they were escorted through
the plant by Mr. R. D. Palmer, an official
of the company. First of all, they were
taken to the experimental laboratories,
which are, as Mr. Palmer explained, a
necessity to any chemical company, al-
though these laboratories are not self-
supporting financially. Several experi-
ments were going on in nearly every lab-

THE DUTIES OF KEEPING WELL

In spite of the careful instructions given the students by Mr. Shepard
and the letter sent to the parents it appears that several of the boys nave
ignored the rules of good health over the rest period. Quite a few have
taken the opportunity to go to movies and other places where they would
mungle with crowds. ‘Lhey have thus not only made themselves ‘open to
contagion but endangered the health of others.

__ 4 flu epidemic is not a thing to be treated lightly ; it is a serious affair.
The victims of it will testify to this. Besides there is always the danger that
this may turn into a pneumonia epidemic with serious result:

A little attention to the simple rules of common sense would do much
to check this outbreak. Coughing or sneezing into one’s handkerchief and

similar simple health measures do not require a great knowledge of medi-
cine but aid doctors in keeping sickness within bounds. None of us enjoy
illness, and the best way to avoid it ourselves is to take care not to give it to
others.

What concerns us most about illness is the havoc it plays with the class-
room schedule. The student's illness as well as that ot the master affects
classes, especially in cases when they must be completely suspended. This
may not seem a disaster to some, but all of us who look forward to con-
tinuing our education in college must remember how important it is to learn

the fundamentals in Prep School. We cannot afford to ignore anything
which hampers our plan of learning as does sickness. The control of illness
is our responsibility to society.

 

 

APPLICATIONS TO COLLEGE

‘This is the season in which the ambitious young senior is busily engaged
in filling out his application for admission to the college of his particular
choice. These are yearly becoming more comprehensive, They now require
not only the complete facts as to a boy’s record, his parents ,and other
matters, but must include an autobiography of the student, his reasons for
choosing the college, or some other composition to show the pupil's char-
acter and the value he places on his own ability. ( ‘ f

Many colleges no longer require a personal interview with the app icant,
but rely on the application to give them the necessary information, A master
should always be consulted before the application is filled out,
care should be taken that only the best of English be used. There

SELF-RULE

A new solution for the troublesome problem of activities in the school
after hours has been working effectively for the past few weeks. There had
been many complaints of damage done to school property by boisterous
students after 1:15. Under the present arrangement only those boys who
eat their lunches regularly in the building are allowed to occupy it after
school. They are under the supervision of one member of their group,
who is responsible for their actions. This has eliminated the annoyance of
others coming in after eating elsewhere. It has also created a responsible
authority to deal with refractory students.

We think this shows clearly that it is possible for the hoys to govern
themselves with a minimum of supervision by the faculty, It demonstrates
that intelligent cooperation by the student body can settle many of the ills
and petty annoyances now afflicting us.

Place in Doubleheader

Mr. Holley’s famed courtiers, on Feb-
ruary 16, took a thrilling game from their
Military Institute opponents to open the
doubleheader basketball games at Bor-
dentown. In a hotly contested struggle
Prep’s second team distinguished itself
in a point to point combat which resulted
in the closest and lowest score of the
season.
As the whistle blew Tom Wenczel,
Prep’s powerful pivot man, got the tap
and the ball was whisked down the slick
court and tossed through the basket so
like a plummet that not even a fringe
was rippled. As the other team vainly
tried to return the coveted sphere to its
own territory, Meyers of Prep snatched
it as it eluded the fingers of the dribbler
and, in a low pass to Gwiazdowski, was
indirectly responsible for Prep's second
tally.

But Prep’s quick beginning seemed for
two long quarters to have been only a
flash in the pan. Warney of Bordentown,
rallying his teammates, successfully held
the Prep boys at bay, until the Red team,
tiring of this teasing, returned to the con-
flict, bloody but unbowed, and, in a qui
succession of passes, scored two more
baskets to bring home the bacon to New
Brunswick.

Rutgers Prep Conquered
By Lawrenceville

Tutwiler Scores 27 Points
For Winners

 

Lawrenceville’s crack basketball team
registered its tenth victory in eleven
starts by defeating Prep 48 to 33. The loss
was Prep’s second defeat of the season,

The game was fast throughout, with
Prep taking the lead in the first quarter
by a score of 6-4. Lawrenceville, led by
Captain Tutwiler, then started to put on
the pressure, and at half time Lawrence-
ville led 24-18.

In the third period Prep came back
fighting for all it was worth, inspired
by Mr. Petke’s pep talk, and almost
matched the Red and Black cagers point
for point. In the fourth quarter Tut-
wiler put on another spurt and led his
team on to a decisive victory by ringing
up nine more points. Tutwiler, who was
high scorer of the game, had a total of
twenty-seven points. Jake Bartow led
the Prep scoring by making fourteen
points. The final whistle blew with Law-
renceville out in front by the score of
48-33.

Points Each

Rutgers Prep crushed Montelair Acad-

out of four starts.

John Kluey shared the high scoring
honors with Jake Bartow, both accounting
for twelve points, while Holzl, of Mont-

Just before the period closed Holzl made
good a foul shot to give Montclair its
only score of the first period.

The second period saw Prep continue
to score, until suddenly Montclair took the
offensive and. scored six points almost
in succession. Bill Hasbrouck made a
magnificent one-handed shot to make the
score 19 to 7 as the first half ended.

When the third period opened Prep
continued its scoring spree, while Mont-
clair fought gamely for only two points.
Holzl was again the star for Montclair.

As the game drew to a close things
began to look bright for Montclair as they
scored seven points. But Prep was not to
be outdone and they topped their oppon-
ents by scoring thirteen points. The game

lly ended with Prep victorious by a
score of 43 to 16.

Lawrenceville Seconds

 

The Jayvees were defeated by Law-
renceville’s second team by a score of
25-12, Although our boys fought hard,
they could not withstand the fast attack
and superior power of the Red and Black.
Bob Clark led Prep with a total of seven
points, while Lawrenceville’s star per-
former was Haaran with six. At half time
Lawrenceville had the lead, 11 to 6. In

Prep Hoopsters
Beaten by Bordentown
Military Institute

Prep's basketball team, which belongs
to the Group III section, was defeated by
a Group IV five at Bordentown February
15. The first half of the game showed
Prep not to be playing their best. Their
attack seemed to be slow in getting under
way, and, by the end of the first half, they
found themselves on the short end of a
12 to 22 score. Seeing the result of the
hrst half, our rooters seemed somewhat
downhearted, but they looked forward con-
fidently to a better half to follow. The
Prep five in the second half proved to be
an entirely different team in their plays
and they also showed much more life.
This sudden inspiration took Bordentown
ot guard, and they were outscored in
the second quarter by three points, bring-
ing the score to 19 to 22 in favor of Bor-
dentown. In the last quarter Prep was
fighting just as hard, but their rivals also
improved their game and the scoring in
that quarter gave cach team six points.
Even though Prep lost the game, it was
a hard fought and thrilling contest.

The team missed a great deal the able
assistance of John Kluey, who was out
of the game sulfering from a twisted ankle.
Mr. Rudy believes that Kluey will be
back in the lineup by next Tuesday, in
order to aid in the game between Prep and
Newark Academy. His high-scoring shoes,
however, were ably filled by Bill Has-
brouck, who piled up eight points. Fol-
lowing this high score of the game was
Bill. Harper with seven points to his
credit. .

Seton Hall Takes
Prep’s Measure

Harper and Moynihan Brilliant
In Defeat

 

The potent Scton Hall five continued
their triumphant march by trampling a
weakened Prep team 49-36, The loss of
John Kluey, stellar forward, proved to be
a great handicap for the Rudymen to
overcome, Although the remainder of the
team fought valiantly throughout the bat-
tle, their efforts were not sufficient to
save them from becoming Seton Hall's
fifteenth quarry.

The superior ball handling of the more
experienced Pirates enabled them to run
up 42 points during the first three quar-
ters so that Prep’s last period spurt was
useless,

During the first half Prep’s collective
eye was so far off that their attack went
completely to pieces, netting them only 15
points, while the fast breaking Seton Hall
team collected 27 by flawless basketball.
Prep, always a strong second-half team,
came back onto the floor determined and
fired by Mr. Rudy’s scintillating pep talk,
but they were foiled when the Pirates
put on their most productive spree of the
game and accounted for 16 more points
before the Maroon and White began to
click, scoring 13 points in the final period.

The scoring honors for Seton Hall were
carried off by Karcowich and Purczycki
who tallied 19 and 10 points respectively.
Bill Harper, lanky center of last year’s
championship team, and Harvey Moyni-
han, another holdover from last year,
paced the Prep quintet by ripping the cords
four times and countering one free throw
apiece. Bill Hasbrouck and Charlie Morfit
came right behind them by ringing up six
points each.

Who knows, maybe we might yet have
a new SCHOOL HOOSE!”"

P.S.—Blame it on Mr.
been studying sonnets.

Harry Garey has found a new way to
economize on cigarettes! He tells Van
Duzer that they will stunt the growth of
his ears.

Having already had one-half year of
plane geometry, I've become quite pro-
ficient in arriving at conclusions. The
following ones were very elusive, but
after a bit of quick thinking I finally
reached the solutions.

“A screw is a nutty person. A nutty
person has no sense. A person who has
no sense is a pauper. But a pauper is a
father. Therefore, a screw is a father.”"—
Q.E.D.

“Cauliflower pertains to ear.
is the product of corn. Corn is the fav
ite drink of the hill-billies. Hill-billies
are moonshiners. Moonshiners use squir-
rel rifles on revenuers, Therefore, cauli-
ower is merely a new way of disposing
of government employees.”—Q. E. D.

P.S.—Maybe Doc will let up when
he sees what he’s doing to me.

L always thought that “Baby Dumpling”
was a character in the funnies. However,
it seems that Prep has its own “Baby
Dumpling.” Anyhow, Bill Clark, one of
the numerous “Pioncer” staff, should be
able to tell you more...

Have you noticed of late how manfully
the hand of Rene Jagenberg has induced
such a commanding tone from the bell
on Mr. Shepard's table? Quite a “ringer,”
that fellow!

“Chuckle! Chuckle!” said the mirthful
potato bug, a smug grin between her an-
tenae, as she laid her first bunch of eggs.
“Just think, in two more weeks I'll have
170,521,764,605,003_ ancestors.” Moral—
Never become a farmer—or a bug col-
lector. “Well, anyhow, it’s one the censor
overlooked ...”

Wah-Hooo! Indians are on the war-
path again! Or maybe it’s just because
Iran; ronmonger isn't feeling well. At
1y , the deadly aim of ango has
d many a feathered redskin to bite
the dust during the past few weeks.

P. S.—It is just as well that some of
you don’t appreciate this one—ask Trango.

While reviewing for my history exam
I saw a page or two devoted to a discus-
sion of the famous “tennis court oath.”
Brings back memories of the fall and
“Shorty” Wolpert .. - Everything was
appropriate except the number of “oath.’

I hear that “Fingers” Ridgway has

turned “Flood-bug.” Although doubting
the authenticity of the rumor that says
“Fingers” is the culprit, I do hear that
the inmates of the top floor of the Delta
House practically had to swim to safety
the other night when a fire extinguisher
mysteriously disgorged its contents upon
he floor.
‘ Place--Gamma House! Time—l A. M.
or thereabouts! _Action—Meceeeyoooo-
www! The plaintive, questioning wail of
a lonely feline floats through my room-
mate’s window and fills the room with its
haunting melody. Instantly the window
flies open and the indignant voice of Red!
Clark shatters the stillness of the night
as he says in no uncertain terms : “Shet
up afore I bap you one! Needless to
say, pussy troubled us no longer. Inci-
dentally the cat was rendering or rending
a very good version of “T Must See Annie
Tonight.” .

Those radio announcers conducting the
recorded programs have some of the clev-

est. advertisement! A typical one:
“Yes, folks, the Up and At ’Em Furniture
Company have some brand new stock.
‘They have some new, slightly used and
used furniture; they have the knotty or
plain variety, etc. Their sensational bar-
gains will astound you, the quality amaze
you, the prices please you, and. the fur-
niture floor you—when you sit in it!

Warning! If you care to preserve your
limbs and keep physically fit and sound,

ot most of the laboratories, and the dif

color were amazing.

The party was then taken through some
more laboratories, in use merely to please
the customers. Here, as in Paris gown

of the plant, where all the money
profits were handled. The outstanding
thing about this section was a machine
which took sales cards, tabulated them,
figured out the exact cost of selling a
certain product, made out the salesmen's
salary checks and did everything else but
turn out the light and say “good-night.”

Going through the workshops the boys
were astonished by the queer smells and
huge mixing bins which seemed to be
everywhere. Mr. Palmer explained that,
although this was considered a dangerous
business, few accidents really occurred.
All around could be seen safety showers,
in case a worker were doused with chemi-
cals, and many placards bearing “Safety
First” mottoes,

Although nearly three hours were spent
in the plant, the group at the end of the
tour had seen only a small portion of
the processes going on there.

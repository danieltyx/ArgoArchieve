Hon. A. Harry Moore, Governor of
w Jersey, was the speaker at. the
tigers University . Sunday

morning, November Vv. Moore

 

for many years has been interested in

 

 

and a sincere friend of the University

would eschew in favor of character

subjugated to a fine character, Gov.
Moore declared and_ illustrated his

thought by a description of his experi-
ence concerning the penal institutions

tories of men incarcerated therein. The
majority of these men were not men
who were never given a chance, but |

men whose characters were not strong
enough to withstand the temptation of
a dishonest act. The speaker then cited

the cases of two formerly prominent
citizens, one a lawyer, the other a
banker these men had come

  
 

from a fine and had been given

every social and educational advantai

  

 

yet each, through some defect in char
acter—not lack of portunity, educa-
tion, money or ability—had fallen into

disgrace.
Living A Useful Life

Many of Gov. Moore's duties have
brought him in touch with State wel-
fare organizations or, as he preferred to
call them, character b
tions, The lamentable fact noted by
the Governor was that year after year

 

 

   

the same small group of people inter- |

ested themselves in these organizations

and devoted themselves to helping |
others, These people were not wasting
their lives, and, though th worked

 

 

long and hard in the service of others,
enjoyed their life. The lack of enjoy
ment and usefulness in the lives of most
people was deplorable

The next point in the address was
advice to conquer the world instead of
allowing the world to conquer you. The
unconquerable approach to life, Gov
Moore thought, was best typified by |
Henley’s poem Invictus. This mental
stalwartness is possessed by few indi
viduals, for it is much easier to comply
with the world about than to exert
oneself

Opening Play In Newman-Prep Game

 

Updike Returning First Kick-off f Against Newman

Orchestra Opens
Concert Series

   

Bach’s, Beethoven's and
Stravinsky’s Work

The Philadelphia, Orchestra, under
direction of Eugene Ormandy, opened
this season's Rutgers Concert see
when it played in the Rutge 1
nasium Monday ning, Ooteber
This occasion marked the first appear-
ance of the Philadelphia Orchestra at
any of the Rutgers concerts.

The program for the evening was
particularly well chosen in that it em-
braced not one special period of musical
development but progressed from the
conventional orchestral style, exempli-
h, to the new and freer form
expression, typified by ciarnsky,

First Offering Is Bach Suite
The first selection on the evening's
program was the Suite Number Three
in D Major by Johann Sebastian Bach.
Since Bach appeared at the end of a
musical epoch, his genius was not so
iated by his contemporaries
as y, and this is so because
he followed faithfully the conventional
musical forms and did not invent any
new or revolutionary ones. However,
his ability was such that he gleaned
every possible bit of beauty from these
conventional forms .

Bach's Third Suite is a series of
dances, both of the drawing room and
country type, unrelated to each other
except by key. One of the movements
of this Suite, the Air, was probably the
most beautiful and is familiarly known
as the “Air for the G String.”

The second number on the program
was the Symphony Number One in €
Major, Opus 21, of Ludwig van Bee-
thoven. When this symphony was first
played, the eritics were unanimous in
their condemnation of it, mainly because
Beethoven was a very original cc
poser and, for his time, a revolution-
ary. People then were accustomed to
music in one mold, and it took a man
of Beethoven's genius to break it. It
is in this first symphony that the
spirited liveliness of Beethoven's later
works makes its appearance.

in the world.
Poultry Farm Attracts Interest
The raising of poultry also received

its share of attention from the visiting
group. The chicken houses and various
lots were inspected, and the students
showed much interest concerning the
raising and care of the fowls. The place
where the students’ private meetings
take place, the log cabin, was visited
by the students, and its purposes and
uses were explained by Mr. Keller. The
cabin was chiefly used for private dis-
cussions between the dean and the stu-
dents. From the cabin, there are no
direct communications with the outer
world.

In spite of the drenching rain that
prevailed during the educational trip,
the students thoroughly enjoyed their
visit. In the course of time it will be
very nice if other students at the Pre-
paratory school be allowed to view the
internal workings of the Rutger's Agri-
cultural School.

POPULARITY

Everyone wants to be popular, not only with his own friends, but
within the large circle of his casual acquaintances. Each of us believes
in his own heart that he has the ability to be well-liked and at the
same time respected by others, and yet some men only become ob-
noxious when they attempt to win their popularity as deliberately as
they would select their winter overcoat. What, then this golden
secret which has inspired such books as “How To Win Friends and
Influence People” and which has made men famous? Clearly, it is not
like women’s cosmetics, to be worn in public and then washed off be-
fore going to bed, but rather it is a quality of character which can be
developed and which is worth any etfort to obtain.

The prime requisites for popularity are friendliness, sincerity and
understanding, Of these, friendliness is the most important, for it in-
spires friendship in others, and it is, after all, friendship that is the
foundation for genuine popularity. Next to friendlin is sincerity,
and by this more is meant than merely refraining from hypocrisy or
burying the axe. The sincere person is one who acts like himself and
does not wag his tongue in puppy-dog fashion about great feats of
personal intrepidity, generally concerned with football or women.
These empty “I done its” pass unbelieved by the majority and, at the
most, bring only boredom. Basically most people prefer themselves
to others, and a sympathetic listener rather than a synthetic “pop-off”
will travel much farther on another's steam than on his own. Acting
naturally, neither better nor worse than you are, is one straight road
toward esteem, the scaffold of popularity.

The last of the three graces is understanding, and the twin sister
of this quality is tactfulness. Understanding is essential in human re-
lationships, for if we realize that the most annoying acts and grievances
are caused by a lack of understanding, sometimes called thoughtless-
ness, the importance of it is then seen. Tactfulness is allied to under-
standing in that it often saves us from embarrassment and from in-
advertently hurting the feelings of our friends.

The popularity which is attainable and genuine is not that ephem-
eral type that floats briefly about an actor or politician in the public
eye but the lasting variety that will, if we have it, follow us all our life.

OBSERVATION

One receives a considerable amount of knowledge by conscien-
tiously observing his companions and associates. A careful observer of
people will mentally catalogue his associates into two distinct groups;
namely, those whose society he finds pleasant and those whose com-
pany he does not particularly desire. From the first of these two groups
come the particular person's closest friends and intimates. The latter
group he mentally discards as having no traits in which he would be
interested. . :

Someone else, however, might observe the group which the pre-
vious person has catalogued as being uninteresting or else to be shun-
ned, and this person may select a close friend from their midst.

This example illustrates the great differences that individuals have
in their conception of what qualities a close friend should possess. —

Of course, it is evident that one should not entirely confine his
observations to humans alone. One learns a great deal merely from
watching nature and her many wondrous creations. While it cannot
be stated that regarding nature is always as enjoyable or as absorb-
ing as observing some of one’s acquaintances, nevertheless, poets
have found inspiration in nature’s works. ’

Thus, we see that the individual who notices the marked charac-
teristics of his neighbors, as well as of nature, is one whose enjoyment
of life is more thorough and much more complete.

Basketball must be a pretty tough
game nowadays. At least Jack Hackett
seems to think that the game’s dan-
gers warrant the use of a pair of foot-
ball shoulder-pads.

Quite a controversy has been in pro-
gress at Mr. Roy's table in the dining
room as to whether ie Bretzfield
is or is not slowly wasting away, due
to the effects of a certain picture in his
room upon his appetite. If the picture
is as good as it is supposed to be, it
would probably cause anyone to lose
his appetite. No offense intended Sam-
mie—merely a compliment on her
merits.

To the audience in the State Theatre
some few weeks ago, during the show-
ing of “The Women”, the most absorb-
ing part of the evening was spent in
listening to a certain inhabitant of the
second floor of the Delta House, Of
course, when a whole row of fellows
simultaneously rose and filed out of the
audience, they received quite an ova-
tion; however, it was plain to see that
the real attraction of the evening had
already been see—pardon me!—heard!

 

  

 

 

 

Prep Midgets In
Slow Return Game

‘The Prep Midgets went down to their
first defeat of the season at Nielson
Field when a heavy and more experi-
enced Peddie team rolled up four touch-
downs to win, 26 to 0. Bob Lamade,
Peddie fullback, was the outstanding
player on the field, scoring three times.

eceiving the ball on the kickoff,
Peddie marched sixty yards for the
first score of the game. Lamade crashed
over from the three yard stripe, and
Al Sande made the point with a run
off tackle.

The second touchdown came late in
the second quarter when Lamade again
carried the ball through center to score.
Peddie had taken the ball at mid-field
and marched straight to the goal line.
Dick Boryello’s run around end ac-
counted for the extra point.

Prep's only scoring threat came in

the closing minutes of the first half
when Phil Rust broke away and ran
forty yards before being downed on the
Peddie twenty yard line. Two line
plays and two passes failed, and Peddie
the ball on downs.
Neither team could break through the
other's defense during the third pe
but Peddie stepped on the gas in the
last frame and clinched the ball game
with two more touchdowns. Lamade
intercepted a pass from Potter intended
for Wells, and ran forty yards to score.
The last touchdown came with but a
minute left in the game when Sande
slid through a hole in right guard after
traveling two yards.

Midgets Gain First
Game From Pingry

Rust, Cramer, Wells Star In
J. V.’s Best Playing Of
Good Season

The Rutgers Prep Midgets played
their third game of the season away at
Pingry and gained their first victory by
an 18 to 7. scor Phe entire team
played outstanding ball, with Mac
Wells and Phil Rust holding the spot-
light,

Shortly after the opening of the game
Prep got possession of the ball on the
fifty yard line after an exchange of
punts. End runs by fleet-footed Phil
Rust, and line bucks with Dick Farkas
carrying the ball put the ball on the
Pingry fifteen yard stripe. Jim Potter
faded and threw a pass to Joe Cramer,
who was waiting in the end zone, for
the first score of the game.

Late in the second pe Prep took
the ball into Pingry territory and
marched to the thirty yard line. Potter
again dropped back and threw a pass
which found the arms of Mac Wells,
who ran the remaining five yards to
score.

Pingry's only tally came late in the
third period on a long march consti-
tuted by ball carrying by Captain New-
comb and Creah. Newcomb drove over
for the touchdown from the two yard
line. A center rush was good for the
extra point.

In the closing minutes of the ball
game Rust skirted right end for forty
yards to set the scene for Prep’s last
score. Two passes, Bob Cramer to
Mack Wells, were good for seventeen
yards and a first down on Pingry's
three yard line. Rust hit the center
of the line for the remaining distance
as the ball game ended.

The superb pass receiving of Mac
Wells and the break away runs of Phil
Rust were the high lights of the Mid-
get's first victory.

Second Period Sees Prep
Outplay Rivals But
Fail To Score

Rutgers Prep dropped its second foot-
ball game of the campaign at Montclair
when the up-State Academy ran up
three touchdowns in the first half to
triumph 19 to 0. Led by their elusive
halfback, Dave Jacobs, Montclair put
on pressure in the opening period only
to be outplayed in the remaining three
quarters by Rutgers.

Mid-way through the initial period
Montclair took the ball on
rty-four after an exchange of punts.
Two line plays, with Dave Jacobs and
Carl Eldredge carrying the ball, netted
On a reverse from John
Jacobs skirted around left end
behind perfect interference and ran
sixty yards for the first score without
a hand being laid on him. Mart Dyer's
placement was no good.

On the kickoff Rutgers received, and
Casper Deschu returned the ball to his
own sixteen, A holding penalty on the
next play put the Prep boys on the one
yard stripe. Al Updike’s punt was low,
and Jacobs returned it from the Rut-
gers twenty-six to the twenty. Three
line plays gave Montclair a first and
ten on the thirteen. An end run by
Post and a line buck by Bob Myers set
the stage for Jacob's second score.
Sweeping around his right end, Jacobs
scored standing up from the nine yard
marker. Dyer's placement was good,
and Montclair was out in front by a

to 0 score.

Early in the second quarter the
“Prepsters” started a drive which ended.
when John Post snagged a pass from
Deschu, intended for Updike, and ran
seventy-four yards to score. The Rut-
so os started on its own twenty-

pass, but Post pulled it down and ran
for the last Montclair score.

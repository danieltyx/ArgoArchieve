Discusses Problem of Faith and
Forgiveness—Holds it Better
Not to Know End of Life

The ever-welcome advent of Dr. Will-
iam Lyon Phelps, Professor Emeritus
of Yale Unive y, came on Sunday
April 30. Dr. Phelps has spoken an-
nually at Rutgers for many y! and
his popularity was indicated by the
tendance which filled the pews

rkpatrick Chapel and overflowed
into the aisles.

For the Scripture reading Dr. Phelps
selected passages from the eleventh
chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews
and the seventh chapter of the Gospel
according to St. Luke, both of which
dealt with faith and forgiveness. The
story of the woman who had sinned,
repentant, and, desiring for-
. had bathed Christ’s feet with
nd dried them with her hair,
‘ad in connection with the topic
iveness.
ses Faith and Christianity
rmon, Dr. Phelps gave a dis-
cussion of faith and Christianity, and
said that in his opinion Christianity
was the only reasonable way of life.
Coupled with this remark, Dr. Phelps

went on to say that he believed faith

stinct. “Throughout the serm

sonal anecdotes concerning several of
the world’s great men, and he told how
a former President of the United
States, John Quincy Adams, although
a very intelligent man and profound
thinker, still said the same prayer
every night that he had been taught
to say as a child, and which begins:
“Now I lay me down to sleep.” This,
Dr. Phelps remarked, was an indication
of Adams’ faith that his simple prayer
for his country and himself would be
as well answered as that of a pompous
church service. He then told a story
about a world-famous philosopher who
dwelt alone and apart in Silesia. This
man for fifty years arose every morn-
ing at five and thought, just thought,
for two hou At the end of fifty years
he wrote a book about those thoughts.
Later, when the man was recognized
as one of the world’s greatest philoso-
phers, a friend asked him what were
the two greatest thoughts he had ever
had. The philosopher replied that a
contemplation of the universe and the
divine moral law within man were the
most profound that had passed through
his mind. Dr. Phelps expanded this
theme to show how a great philosopher
had compared the whole great uni-
verse with every star and galaxy in it
to the moral law within every man
from the lowest to the highest.

What Happens When We Die?

Dr. Phelps then took another theme:
that often repeated question of what
happens to us when we die. Instead
of making the usual optimistic guess,
Dr. Phelps went on to say that it was
better for us not to know the end of
life. He illustrated this point of view
with an example of how futile religion
would be if we knew what was in
store for us. Pretending to throw a
ten dollar bill in the aisle, he told a
man sitting nearby that if he did not
steal the money he would receive a
million dollars. That would not be
honesty, contended the speaker, to lay
aside a little money in order to re-

Prep Golfers Halve
Match With Hun

Come Back to Down Linden
High Team, 62 to 5%

Rutgers Prep golfers defeated a high-
ly favored Linden High School contin-
gent last week by the score of 64-54%.
Previously they had split an exciting
match with Hun School by the score
6-6.

The first match of the season was
played on the Princeton University golf
course against Hun. Dick Meyers, num-
ber one man for Prep, and Howard
Dietz played in the first foursome.
Meyers played beautiful golf to halve
the first round with Bill Cranberry of
Hun, collecting 1% point, but he was
unable to maintain the pace, thereby
losing the second nine and the match.
Dietz lost the first nine but made a
comeback to win the second nine and
halve the match, thus adding 1% points
to the Prep score. In the second four-
some Robert Weindel and Robert Cra-
mer represented Prep. Weindel won the
last nine, but lost the first nine and
the match. The tieing points were
picked up by Cramer when he won both
nines and the match.

Beat Linden

After tieing Hun, the Prep golf team
came back and downed the Linden
team by the slim margin of one-half a
point. Meyers, playing in the first four-
some, picked up three points by win-
ning both nines and the match, five up
and four to go. Dietz halved his first
nine to add the winning 4 point to
the Prep score. Weindel won his match
four up and three to go, while Cramer,
in the same foursome, lost his match,

Prep Tennis and
Track Stars Win

In Interscholastics

“MacKay and Jagenburg Take
Tennis and Track Awards
Respectively

In the George School Interscholastic
Tennis Championship matches, held at
The George School near Newtown, Pa.,
Rutgers Prep was one of eight par-
ticipants, and met, as the result of a
draw, opponents from George School,
Trenton High School, Bordentown Mili-
tary Institute, St. Andrews School, St.
James School, and Pennington. Prep
was represented by MacKay, Farley,
Kellogg, and Coad in tennis, and by
Jagenburg, Flynn and Brooke in track.

Considering the limited time the ten-
nis team has had for practice, due to
the inclement weather, they made a
good showing, Kellogg, Farley and
Coad were eliminated in the first round
of their tournament, after putting up a
strong battle. MacKay, however, came
through with flying colors and reached
the final round. His first opponent he
took easily, although he lost the sec-
ond set due to a freak of luck. The
next match was more difficult, as a
player much MacKay's type opposed
him, Both were steady, deadly shots
and untiring. MacKay managed to pull
the match out of the fire and win, This
brought him to the finals which were
nerve racking because of the large
crowd. It was no disgrace that MacKay
lost this match, for he was dead tired
after his two previous encounters.
MacKay, throughout the tournament,
played a steady, curate and sensible
game, without nking unnecessary
chances and always knowing where
the ball was. He was awarded a bluo
ribbon for being runner-up in Class
One.

There was a consolation match for
those who had been put out in their
first round. In this, Farley and Coad
lasted one round, but were beaten in
the finals by stronger opponents. Kel-
logg met a stronger man in his match
and was eliminated.

Arnold Leads
School With 93.8

Forty-One Percent of Seniors
Win Places

 

 

The final monthly honor roll of the
year was announced by Mr. Stanley
Shepard, Jr. on Thursday, May 11.
Although the average mark was con-
siderably lower than in previous
months, there were twenty-seven stu-
dents above the eighty mark, which is
just one less than the largest group to
make the Honor Roll during any one
month this year. The entire school was
led by James Arnold with the only
average above ninety. Following him
as a group of eight boys with an
average between eighty-five and ninety
and then another group of eighteen
between eighty and eighty-five.

There were nine boys over eighty-five
this month, and of these seven were
Seniors. Forty-one percent of the Senior
class made this Honor Roll, while
last month only thirty-nine percent ob-

tained averages better than eighty,

Another point worthy of notice is that

while the general average of the school
dropped, the number of Senfors above
eighty-five increased from eleven per—
cent to nineteen percent. In fact there
were more Seniors over eighty-five last
month than during any previous
month.

Lower Class Leaders

The lower classes shared hoonrs, each
being represented by four boys. This
was a decline for the Junior and
Freshman classes but a gain by the
Sophomores, vid Beardslee led the
Freshman class, Willem Rudolfs the
Juniors, while James Cook maintained
his position at the top of the Sopho-
more class,

In announcing the Honor Roll, Mr.
Shepard congratulated the newcomers
and gave an ominous warning to all
when he said that Commencement was
only five weeks off.

FALSE RUMORS

It has become quite a common practice among certain boys in
our school during the past year to exchange gossip and rumors about
other students, and especially concerning the school itself. This
custom cannot but have a pernicious effect upon the morale of the
students, leaving them with unjust ideas and prejudices—which
cannot be successfully combatted because they are usually not
known by the persons involved. There is nothing more dangerous to
a reputation than idle and untruthful gossip. The worst of it is that
a tale, once set in motion, will grow of its own momentum, until a
harmless incident becomes the basis for the strongest suspicions.

At the present time we are in school to acquire an education.
Education involves discipline of the mind as well as the acquisition
of knowledge. No one is mature until he has acquired a sensibility
which will enable him to scorn the slanders born of ignorance and
petty malice. We should strive to control our processes of forming
opinions, and we cannot do this until we free ourselves from the
habit of “snap judgments” based on the prejudices of others rather
than on a solid foundation of fact and deliberate thought. The abil-
ity for fair and intelligent judgment is the basis for sound financial
success.

The old saying, “The child is father to the man,” has a strong
element of truth. Unless you endeavor to control your mind during
its formative years, you will be greatly handicapped in later life.
And you will find it much more difficult to train yourself later in
life than if this were done today.

 

WAR’S DESTRUCTION OF DEMOCRACY

Probably the greatest disaster of war—even greater than the

y S i human life—is the fact that democracy ends as
ae ae or even peter the ace ee
We see this clearly in the light of the present w glace ae
land and France, the so-called democracies’ or = ee pe,

‘erful military state.

ee he. Gist War freedom even in this country was or
tailed to a great extent. Many injustices were eee : :
confusion that accompanied our entrance into the Contes n o
erance was rife, and no man could be sure that his neighbor w ae
a “200 per cent American,” ready to denounce him as a spy. is
was especially true for those of German birth or parentage.

Without freedom true progzess is impossible. _This is the. reason
why ages of war have always been ages in which civilization has
declined. Augustus’ era of peace was the era of Rome's greatest
cultural achievement, and of her greatest prosperity. Had even a
fraction of the money spent on the last war been utilized instead
for the development of the world’s natural resources we would not
have undergone the travails of depression. The energy and resources
now being put into armament by the great powers of Europe could
bring us into a period of unexampled prosperity if devoted to the
building up of new industries and of undeveloped areas, such as
South America and Central Africa. Such a building up process is
impossible without free initiative.

It is sometimes difficult, even in times of peace, to preserve our
basic rights. But in wartime, with the inevitable regimentation
and organization of a super state which accompanies it, it becomes
impossible. When this regimentation is temporary, the result is
most fatal. However, when war is imminent for a long period of
time, the people of the nations, and especially their youth, will be-
come imbued with the philosophy of force. Then democracy is fin-
ished, and the long and painful process of regaining freedom must
be undergone again before progress can be continued.

 

the usual heated arguments about the
merits of any team or player can be
overheard. Although we are not “jive”
as far as baseball goes, we still wouldn't
make the following little wager. It
seems that every time the Pirates win
a game, besides declaring a national
holiday, a certain master wins one
cigarette. However, every time the
Yanks win, said master donates a butt
to a student who is smarter than he
looks. We are still rootin’ for the

A distinctly feminine voice inquired

no uncertain terms that as far as the

Was absolutely non-coed. Evidently the

Kluey’s Runs
Stop Wardlaw, 6-3

Eighth Inning Sees Prep Pass
Opp-nents

John Kluey’s double and triple hits,
in the first and third innings respec-
tively, helped Rutgers Prep’s baseball
team win its second game out of four
starts. Prep’s victory over Wardlaw,
in a game which bad been postponed
from Avril 18 to May 4, was doubly
welcome after the loss of the Mont-
clair game.

Ward!aw led in the game up to the
seventh inning with a score of 3-2. In
the seventh and last inning of the
official game Morfit got a clean single
hit over the head of the Wardlaw sec-
ond baseman. After Morfit stole sec-
ond. Kluey hit a long lopping fly to
center field. Just as Morfit was coming
‘nto third the center fielder dropped
the ball, thus enabling Morfit to score
the tieing run. Under the artful pitch-
ing of Ferd Ratti, who replaced Bartow
in the fourth inning, Wardlaw was
unable to score another run.

Tn the eighth, an extra inning, Prep’s
hall handlers scored three more runs.
Fred Parkinson, pinch hitting for Wer-
ner, got a hit on an error, thus sending
Kolakowski home from second base
for the winning score. However, Prep
did not discontinue to score, for Park-
inson and Marvin brought in two more
runs, In the Wardlaw half of the
eighth Ratti again held his opponents
scoreless.

tered the Rutgers Prep tennis team its
second defeat of the season last Friday

bault of Seton Hall both scored double
victories.

MacKay played his usual fine game
of steady tennis to down Behon 6-3,
and then teamed with Kellogg to
score the only other Prep win of the
day. They had little difficulty in win-
ning from Behon and Masterman 6-3,

Admiral Farragut
Submerges Prep

Ball Team, 14-1

Kupecki’s pitching helped Admiral
Farragut School defeat Prep, 14-1, by
pitching a one hit game, and knocking
a home run in the fifth inning of the
game on May 10, This was Prep‘s third
defeat in five starts.

Although Parkinson, who was re-
lieved by Jake Bartow in the sixth in-
ning, pitched very well, the Little Navy
team just could not be stopped. In five
innings they collected fourteen hits
from Parkinson, and two hits from
Bartow in one inning.

Prep started the game off with one
run in the first inning, their only score
throughout the game. Ferd Ratti,
Prep’s leadoff man, got a walk, and
so did Morfit. The next man was John
Kluey, who having gone hitless in every
game since the season began, hit a fly
to the center fielder. John Schmidt
then came to bat, and got the first
and last hit of the game for Prep. This
hit brought in Charlie Morfit, in order
to score the first run of the game, and
the last run for Prep.

In Admiral Farragut’s half of the
first inning, the Little Navy boys
scored two runs, thus putting their
teams out in front by a score of 2-1.

After the first inning was over, it
looked as though the men from Tom's
River were going to have a hard
game on their hands, but soon the ball
game was all theirs. Although Prep
played hard and one of its best games,
they were up against a ball team which
has had eight victories in as many
starts to its credit.

ent time concerns “Milk” Schmidt.
Something must have happened to
“Smitty” during the past few weeks—
look at his grades! Only a mere S4
average! There must be s ething in
the saying that late hours, “Milk,” and
nineties don’t mix—eh, Johnnie?
The worries of Mr. Stearns’ Latin
class seem to be over as far as passing
is concerned. Mr. Stearns had stated
that it would take enough money to
luy him a new sailboat to cause the
class to pass. The next day there re-
posed on said gentleman’s desk a most
neat and trim schooner, capable of
weathering the roughest gale that a
bathing man might blow up—in the
tub, of course.
Do you know what a “pazooda” is?
Well, neither do we, but you might ask
“Percival” Harper. I hear that he's
been saving them for quite a while now.
“Chink” Turner just loves his
brother's mechanical tendencies! Yes,
Doug greased “Chink’s” car—by plac-
ing with his finger, bits of grease on
every grease cup. Oh well, it has been
said that necessity is the mother of
invention—just as invention is the
brain child. You can see that it’s quite
a family affair.
Anyone having any old match boxes,
bottle caps, etc., may find opportunity
to engage in a bit of collective bar-
tering with Mr. Shepard and with
Harry Garey. It seems that the afore-
mentioned gentlemen are authorities
on the subjects, since there seems to
be the matter of a hobby on hand.
Don’t ever try to tell me that only
children can have fun on the sliding
boards in Buccleuch Park. The look
of complete rapture and perfect hap-
piness that was on the countenance of
our own “Darling” Brooke, as he slid
gracefully down the curving decline of
the positively breath-taking sliding
board (five feet four and one-half
inches high), gave mute testimony to
the fact that no matter how old a per-
son may be, there is still within him
certain something that needs ont.
bit of prompting to complete a re
tation that is truly wonderful to be-
hold.

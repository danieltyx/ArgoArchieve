Mr. Sperduto

New History Instructor

Joins Upper School Staff

There is an addition to the upper
school faculty this year in the person
of Mr. Frank Sperduto. Mr. Sperduto
will teach three courses: United States
History, a ninth grade world geography
course and a course called “The United
States and the World” to the eighth
grade.

Mr. Sperduto was graduated from
Rutgers where he majored in history,
and he has received his master’s de-
gree. Currently he is working toward
his doctorate.

Seventh grade teacher five years

For the past five years Mr. Sperduto
has taught the seventh grade in the
lower school. He has been the upper
school’s J.V. coach, and for the last
three years instructed regular gym
classes for the sixth and seventh grade
boys. This, and the fact that he has
taught at the lower school so long, has
made him quite well-known to those
who have passed from the lower to the
upper school,

Oddly enough, the students of Mr.
Sperduto’s first seventh grade class
are r seniors and will help compose
his US.

 

 

History class. Therefore, Mr,
Sperduto will have no difficulty in
adjust to his new position,

Mr. and Mrs, Frank Sperduto

baby girl, Heather, on August 2.

Three New Courses
Strengthen Schedule

The schedule this year includes three
new courses. These are an advanced
literature course for seniors, world
geography for freshmen and German.

The literature course is open to any
senior who believes he can handle the
job, since he will be studying English
IV in addition to it. Mr. Dumarae’s
plans for the course, completed this
summer, and Mrs. Wilson’s plans for
English IV will be correlated so that
the ideas developed in English IV will
be carried over and expanded in Mr.
Dumarae’s class.

Either world geography or Ancient
History is available to freshmen this
year, so that they can build a better
background for the more advanced
history courses.

German is back on the schedule for
the first time in some years. Mrs
Rooda, who has a German accent that
could fool a Nazi officer, is instructing
the course.

With the addition of these three
courses the schooi will have a curricu-
lum that will offer each student four
years of science, mathematics, English,
and history plus the required units in
any of four foreign languages.

HEP HAMBURGER HOP!

The student council has planned a
“Hamburger Hop” for Saturday, Sep-
tember 21 at the school gymnasium.
The main purpose of the barbecue is
to enable the students to become better
acquainted.

Refreshments consisting of ham-
burgers, hot dogs, and soft drinks will
be served. The faculty will do the
cooking over portable grills lent by
the students. Music for the “Hop”
will be supplied by any student who
wishes to contribute records. If the
weather is fair, the event will take
place on the basketball court adjoin-
jing the gym, In case of rain the bar-
| becue will move inside the gym.

The “Hamburger Hop” is a wonder-
ful chance for new and old students
to meet, and every student should

 

plan to attend this first social event

 

of the school year.

Headmaster Discusses Future Status
Of Independent Prep

aratory School

by David M. Heinlein

It is with deep pleasure that I wel-
come each of you members of the
student body of Rutgers Preparatory
School. Today we begin our 192nd year
of service in the educational traditions
of our country.

This 192nd year is a noteworthy one,
for the School is now a truly independ-
ent school. On July 1 of this year our
Board of Trustees assumed full con-
trol of this historic school.

The record of this school has been
one of honor and distinction. Its grad-
uates have taken their places in fine
colleges, professions and community
life. Each of you has a future in our
country; each a responsibility to de-
velop your talents and understanding
to the utmost.

As you face this year of study and
activity, yvyu should feel confident of
your ability to earn a place among thie
others who have preceded you. News-
Papers, Magazines, radio and television
have been featuring the so called
“tidal wave” of students. If you are to
believe the statistics they quote your
chances for a college education would
appear slim, indeed. I would like to
say that your chances of entering college
after graduation are extremely good!
You have the necessary ability, and
you will be receiving the necessary
preparation for college work. You are
a student in a fine school, being in-

structed by an outstanding faculty.
Make the most of this opportunity
which your parents and the School

give to you.

Astronomy Club Participates
In Geophysical Year Studies

During the summer the members of
the Astronomy Club have had the
opportunity to play a part in the
International Geophysical Year’s visual

 

meteor program. The purpose of this
program is to secure more accurate
statistics on the number of meteors
of various sizes encountered by the
earth.

Each member received from Mr.
Heinlein a report form on which to
record data concerning the sighting

of meteors on specified nights. These
reports will be sent to the National
Research Council in Ottawa, Canada
to be compared with radar sightings.

Summer Students

One hundred and fifty students at-
tended the six week summer session at
this school from June 24 to August 2.

The students enrolled to improve
their grades in one or two of the fif-
teen courses taught by nine teachers.
Two of these teachers came from New
Brunswick and Manasquan high schools
and the remaining seven were the
regular faculty.

Coach Richard O’Connell conducted
a basketball camp at our gym from
August 12 to 23. The camp ‘was for
boys in the area who were interested
in improving their game.

ther basketball coaches from pre-
paratory and high schools and some
well known basketball _ peysonalities,
notably Dick Gains and Chet Forte,
one of the countries leading scorers
last year, assisted Coach O’Connell.
The boys worked out inside the gym
and on the outdoor court and were
shown film strips taken by the New
York Knicks.

Both the summer session and the
basketball camp were established as a
service which this school wishes to

render for the betterment of our com-
munity.

‘Oak’ Leaves In Fall

by Jonathan Margolis

After five years of coaching some of

us after a year's leave of absence dur-|OUr finest athletic teams, Richard S.

ing which he taught English in French}
Indochina on a _ Fulbright teaching
assignment.

Mr. Gaggini held his position on the
faculty for five years before his ab-
sence. He has returned to resume his
teaching of French and Spanish and
again act as adviser on our yearbook,
the Ye Dial, where his presence was
most missed.

Since his departure, Mr. Gaggini has
become a world traveler. He visited
Cambodia's surrounding areas during
his vacations, and his trip home in-
cluded stops in India and Pakistan and
short sojourns in Beirut, Lebanon
and Istambul, Turkey. On the final
leg of his trip Mr. Gaggini visited
Athens, Rome and Paris and arrived
home August twentieth.

Miss Warr turns “pedaler”

Miss Warr has literally pedaled her
way through the summer while leading
an American Youth Hostel Group bi-

cycle trip across the United States and
into Canada.

The group traveled most of the way
by bicycle, but in Canada’s rough
country and in sparsely inhabited
areas which would be almost impossible
to travel by bicycle, buses and trains
were made available to the cyclists.
The trains they used were specially
equipped box cars with living facilities
including cooking units which were
necessary in the wnpopulated areas
through which they passed.

Miss Warr, who taught eighth grade
courses last year, will take Mr. O’Con-
nell’s position as biology and general
science instructor in addition to teach-

 

 

 

ing Eighth Grade English.

SCHEDULE 1957-58

PERIODS

 

O'Connell has left his position to take
a place in the physical education de-
partment of the new Piscataway Town-
ship High School.

Mr. O’Connell became coach in 1952.
Since then our basketball teams have
consistantly ranked among the best
in the area. In five years O'’Connell-
coached basketball teams won 64 games

and lost 39, a most commendable .621
percentage.

In 1952-3 the Prep team completed
a 10-10 record and the next three
seasons rank among the best in our
history. Al Marasko broke the school
record during the '53-’54 season and
led the team to fourteen victories with
only three defeats. The following year
ended with a 15-3 record. In 1956
Coach O’Connell’s squad won th Group
III state tournament.

The “smiling Irishman” has _ kept
things lively both in sports and in his
science classes. Although his presence
will be missed, we wish him luck in
his new position.

Trustees Vote To Buy Site

The Board of Trustees has approved
a plan to acquire a 7% acre site on
River Road which would be used for
the lower school. The present building
must be vacated by June 1, 1958.

 

The board voted to make an offer
for the property of Eugene R. Julian.
The purchase will be financed both
by mortgages and gifts from alumni
and students’ parents.

If their offer is accepted, the board
will consider the purchase of an ad-
joining nine acres for the site of a
new upper school.

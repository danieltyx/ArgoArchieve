Reports Ropah...

It is the Argo’s policy to do things
in the American Tradition
what?). We investigate all rumors,
going to all costs to protect the vic-
tims of malicious scandals so that
JUSTICE may triumph
(corny, what?)

Well folks, you goofed again. Con-
trary to popular belief, Andy Zacky
Holley doesn’t spend all his time in
jacket and tie.

We played it kool; by concealing
our reporter, Steve Ropah, in A.Z.’s
briefcase, we smuggled him into Andy's
house. At midnight Steve shnook out

of the briefcase to discover A.Z.
asleep, JACKETLESS!!
We realize that disproving these

rumors, in which so many believed so
strongly, is enough to rattle some
people’s faith in Holley.

Tommy Takes Title

On May 1 Thomas G. (Gasket)
Dumarae (the only one in captivity)
of the Rutgers Prep Hot Rod and
Bible Reading Association piloted his
hot Dumocracy II to a class D (pedal
car) championship at Hoboken. Mild
mannered Dumarae, or Tight Throttle
Tommy he is known around the
strip, breezed through his three elim-
inations with little trouble. He even
set a new world’s record of 30 min.

Senior Day Edition, 1957

Headmaster Nabs Vandals,

GUS GOOFS
LAB GOES

One of our student’s eager quests
for knowledge paid off this week. Un-
fortunately, instead of benefitting the
swingle, it paid off for the local lab-
oratory supply house. Gus Daviet, one
of Prep’s up-and-coming chem stu-
dents (he has recently hit double
figures on his report card), has the
distinction of being the first Prepster
to succeed in breaking every glass
instrument in the lab.

It seems that several days ago Gus
found the lab open, with nary a teach-
er in sight. He creeped into the lab,
locking the portal behind him. Ap-
proximatabobble three quarters of an
hour later, the sturdy Prep building
quivered on its footings as a tremen-
dous explosion exploded. The multitude,
which was inhabiting the study hall
at the time, migrated to the windows.
Some individuals reasoned that Mrs.
Rooda was endeavoring to park her
vehicle in that plot of land which is
set aside for parking vehicles. Others
inferred that Georgie’s submarine-
chaser had fallen from its precarious
position atop his motor scooter. The
more erudite of the herd hastened to
the lab, where the fumes were begin-
ning to settle to the floorboards.
There on the bottom surface of the
ocean lay Daviet in a Moffat-like
contortion. With grim determination
the rescuers became dead. They then
commenced efforts to remove his nose
from his physiognomy. This gets me

| There has been a rash of insubor-
|dination and total disregard of the
rules and regulations on the part of
some of the students here. Consequent-
ly, Headmaster Hancox’ Happy Hour
is fun-filled to capacity. A lot of
varied opinions had been given to us,
but we wanted to get the official word
on why so many of our students have
nad to endure this torture.

“It is really quite simple,” smiled
Headmaster Hancox as he tore the
legs off a grasshopper. “In this age
of mass communications it is often
feasible to ascertain the relative prox-
imity of the transgressor and the
degree to which he is committing this
leinous contradiction of our statutes.
In short, I’ve got ‘stoolies.’”

STOOLIE REPORTS

Just as he was saying those words,
a stoolie with the initials Daniel
Anthony Wallace burst breathlessly
into the office. “Chief,” he said, “Big
News! Guy Blake is chewing gum at
his desk in the Study Hall!”

“Good work,” Headmaster Hancox
said as he gave his most promising
stoolie thirty pieces of yen. ‘“Here’s
where the fun begins.”

BLAKE, MOFFAT CAUGHT

Guy Blake didn’t have a chance.
Headmaster Hancox snuck up behind
him and roared out, “Caught you!”
Poor Guy was so frightened he fell
down so hard that his uppers came
loose. “You know it’s against the rules
to chew gum in school, don't you?”
demanded Headmaster Hancox.
“Mmgphh”, said Guy. “Put that por-
celain back in your mouth immediate-
ly.” said Headmaster Hancox. “I want
an explanation.”

“Well,” he began, “I got to thinking
about Connecticut and my mouth

From The
Editor’s Desk

Since this is the last edition of the
Argo that will be put out under my
editorship, I would like to take this
opportunity to thank all the members
of my staff for the invaluable aid
which they gave me. I would also like
to express my gratitude to the stu-
dents who, although they were not
considered on the staff, so generously
gave up their time to help with the
production of our newspaper and an-
nual magazine.

In case any of you are puzzled, I
would like to explain this edition of
the Argo. We are experimenting with
this paper to find out how the student
body will react to an edition which
the staff thinks is funny. For this
reason, we used a staff made up en-
tirely of Juniors and Seniors.

In this edition as you probably have
noticed, we actually satirized the
teachers at Prep. Our reason for this
is simple. We wanted to show the
teachers that we notice them, too.
And, although we are jesting at some
of their habits or actions, we are
really showing that the teachers are
human. However, we do hope that all
the teachers are good humored enough
to understand that we meant no of-
fense by printing this edition.

As a warning to all students, I
want to remind you that the informa-
tion given in this paper is not true,
and any resemblance to actual occur-
rences is purely co-incidental.

As you probably have realized, the
next edition of the Argo will be print-
ed under the editorship of Louise
DiLalo. I hope that you will all co-
operate with her and help her produce
a fine paper. Remember, a_ school

SPOR TLIGHT

Sheik Dranreb Remhsrak

Spring is when a young man’s fan-
cies turn to Baseball. Well around
Prep the Baseball Bug has bitten some
of the Prepsters pretty bad. Coach
Medinets ex-all state footy, potty, and
badminton selection, says that some
of his younger ball players, such as
Guy F. Blake and Andreas Zorch
Holley, show much promise. Despite
the fact that Blake, who runs the
base pads in 7-' minutes and has a
fielding percentage of -.999, has hit
into 12 unassisted triple plays (only one
more than Grace Wilkerson’s record),
Medinets believes that he will develop
into a good ballplayer. With Blake at
second, Holley at short, and fabulous
Stretch Moffat at first, Medinets be-
lieves he has one of the best double
play combos in the county.

The only trouble with Moffat is his
great tendency to argue with the
umpire. Just the other day Moffat
was thrown out of the game against
the School for the Blind for using his
Trainee Beater on the umpire after he
was called out on strikes. Gus Daviet,
Dave Heinlein, and Thomas Dumarae,
Prep’s fine outfield, did a good job
against the Blind School despite the
lopsided score of 23-1

The sport staff here at the Argo has
just received word that 5° 2” Tommy
Dumarae has been nominated to the
All American Bask | Leam at center.

On Wednesday, April 31, Coach Andy ;
Piscatelli’s highly rated Prep nine, led |
by exBloomfield High School all-state
hurler, Dick O'Connell, bowed to New-
ark School for the Blind, 23-1. How-
ever, to the disappointment of Coach
Piscatelli and Assistant Coach Jacko-
witz, the husky youth from North
Jersey was unable to get anyone out
in the first inning. After 23 runs had
crossed the plate, Prep’s basketball
nominee for All-American, Tom Du-
marae, came in to strike out the next
21 men to face him. The Blind Men

 

Students Challenge Faculty

On May 24, the students and their
faculty will play their annual soft-ball
game. Last year, the faculty won a
confused contest, and now the peda-
gagues desperately are figuring out
their opening line-up.

“Stretch” Moffat will start at first
base. “Stretch” has an amazing capa-
city for twistling limbs, and he can
really cover the bag. Slick fielding
Tom “Greek” Dumarae will open up at
second. He should be all right if he
can remember which way to run after
he hits the ball. At third base, Guy
Blake will hold fort. Guy can hit the
ball the way to Connecticut.

Hard hitting Dave Heinlein will
roam the pastures in left field, while
in center, Gus Daviet will cover yea}
much ground with his usual skill. |
“Yogi” O'Connell will be behind the |
plate, flashing signals to gum-chewing |
pitcher A. Z. Holley. If the students
start hitting Holley, A. Z. will just hold
the period over for five minutes.

swung at Tommy’s tricky servings as
if they couldn’t even see the ball.

PREPSTERS IMPROVE

All wasn't gloomy for the Prepster’s,
however. Coach Piscatelli said the lit-
tle Scarlet have come a long way in
hitting since the beginning of the
year. Clean-up hitter Blake, who in-
cidentally set two records by making
12 errors in one inning and _ hitting
into his twelth unassisted triple play,
managed to go 3 for 4 at the plate.
First baseman Moffat, before he was
thrown out of the game for arguing
with the umpire and throwing Trainee
Beaters at the fans, had a prefect day
at the plate.

PREP RALLIES

Prep rallied in both the sixth and
the seventh innings. In the sixth, with
the bases loaded and A.Z. Holley at
the plate, it seemed for certain Prep
would score. However, “Slugger” Daviet,
who had walked to first, tried to steal
second but was cut down. In the
seventh, A.Z., who was still up, con-

nected for his 68th homer of the
season tO prevent a Prep shutout.
Throughout the game, Prep batters

were swinging wildly at the offerings
of the School for the Blind pitchers,
who at times seemed to have lost
sight of the plate.

Teacher of the Day

It has been a policy of the Argo each
month to pick who they believe is
the outstanding teacher of the month.
This month the honor has been be-
stowed upon your friend and mine,
Mr. Aaron Medinets. Medinets, our
fine physics teacher has gained respect
from all for his unorthodox teaching
techniques. He is the only teacher in
the school who on tests gives the
answers and the students must fill in
the questions. Also, the Argo staff
wishes to congratulate Mr. Medinets
on being elected “Cigar Smoker of the
Month”. He won this coveted award
for taking the most accurate readings
of used cigar butts in his mercuric
graduated cylinder. Also, Mr. Medinets
must be congratulated for his fine
road record in his moving Willys. He
won first prize in the New Jersey As-
sociation of High School Teachers
Drag Enthusiasts by nosing out a
Chrysler 300 at the wire.

Student of the Day

Well, kids, just dig our student of
the day, Margie Wilson. Boy! Is she
hep to the jive! And that crazy D. A.
It makes you flip your lid.

Look at her in English class, chew-
ing her double bubble, chewy juicy
bubble gum, six bubbles to the minute.
English is definitely not her subject,
but do let us get to her attributes.

We have chosen Margie for the
magnificent acedemic progress she has
displayed recently. Although she’s still
failing English, her overall average
has flipped 16 points to a zangy 16.
Now she’s all shook up because her old
man is going to buy her that creamy,
dreamy, peachy, and gleamy fluores-
cent Elvis Presly Kissing Lipstick.

Her extra-curricular activities are
many and varied Margie can jump
higher than any other cheerleader,
talk louder than anyone in study hall,
and write the longest, most discom-
bobulated articles for the Argo. At the
moment her most ardent extra cir-
ricular activity complaining about
her persecution complex.

CLUB NEWS

NAVIGATION CLUB

An unusual incident toook place at

the last weekly meeting of the Naviga-
tion Club. Mad George Moffat, a

junior, was demonstrating the use of

a 1957 Mercury Hurricane Motor when,
to the astonishment of the club mem-
bers, the motor
began to lurch spasmodically out of
the room.

After a few panic ridden moments
George succeeded in getting a half-
nelson on the Mercury and rode it to
a screeching halt just before it crashed
through the doors of the lab.

Next week Mad George will discuss
the transporting of sailboats on Eng-
lish Fords and the correct posture to
assume while painting the bottom of
a sailboat which is perched on top of
a car.

ASTRONOMY CLUB

Yesterday in Tokyo, David Heinlein,
a retired one armed paper hanger,
made an astonishing discovery with
his .0000000002 power astronomical
telescope. at 6:15 (Tokyo time) he
sighted and photographed sunspots on
the moon. When asked how often this
occurred, Dave remarked, “Once in a
blue moon.”

Upon his return to the United States
via the Burma Road and Goethel
Bridge, Heinlein expects to pursue his
meddlings at the Panhandle Minand
Agriculture College in Oklahoma. In
the future Dave hopes to observe the
Martians tripping over their lower lips
on Mars.

Dave's telescope is a most interesting
contraption. Constructed from six feet
of exhaust manifold, and two broken
mirrors from the Starlight Room of
the Holland Tunnel, this scope has
proved to be very accurate.

Student Talk

The faculty has just rewarded George
Moffat (track star) a two week vaca-
tion for jogging wind sprints up and
down the fire escape.

Antoinette Rooda is scheduled to
appear in court on May 13, 1957 for
charges of hit and run driving and
resisting arrest. While driving down
the mountain last Friday, she knocked
over four babycarriages, five traffic
officers, and six contestants on the
Ted Mack Original Amateur Hour.

Reports show that a Tom Dumarae
was caught speeding on his pogo
stick en route to the National Museum
of International Automobiles.

Guy Blake, whose great claim to
fame is the ownership of a 1953 Grand
Prix Red Ram, V-8 Dodge, opened up
this hot machine yesterday on Spring
Alley and was timed at 30 m.p.h. with
the wind.

It was reported that A.Z. Holley is
responsible for the footprints found
on the ceiling of the Girl’s room.

TOMMY...Cont. from pg. 1

(mainly because his hair was on fire).
After a slight bandaging job Dumarae
lined up next to Alfred H. Neuman
(brother of Alfred E. Neuman of footy
fame) and when the flag went down,
Dumarae gathered a substantial lead
and lead the rest of the way.

The Dumocracy III is a 1902 Ruts-
mobile (you can’t hardly find them
no more) powered by a Schwinn racer
sprocket and pedals (oi gavalt, such
power) and a chain from a 26 inch
girl's Rollfast. The rear axle has a
variable zorch ratio controlled by a
three speed dualframesresupitator (pro-
nounced dua-lf-am-esr-esu-pi-tat-or)
from a Raliegh Sports special Eng-
lish bike (pronounced Eng-lish bike).

Because of his strong showing at
Hoboken the Prep Timing Association
has paid for a one way ticket to
Siberia so that Tommy may compete
against the Russian (pronounced Red)
Dog Sled Team.

Opera Guild Offers
Puccini Masterpiece

Forty-two students will go to the
opera, Tosca by Giacomo Puccini on
March 8.

Briefly, the outline of Tosca is this:
Tosca, a beautiful singer, is the jeal-

ous lover of Mario Cacaradosse, a
religious artist. Angelotti, a fleeing
prisoner, hides in the church in

which Mario is painting. Mario helps
him to escape. Scarpis, chief of Roman
police, enters the church and, not
finding Angelotti arrests Mario as an
accomplice, and orders him to be
shot. Tosca promises herself to Scarpia
to rescue her lover, and Scarpia orders
a fake execution of Mario. When he
returns to claim her, she stabs him.
At dawn the pretended execution of
Mario takes place. Tosca hurries to
the prone figure of her lover, after
the firing, and finds Mario dead.
Hearing noises of approaching soldiers,
she realizes that her murder of
Scarpia has been discovered. Climbing
the prison walls, she leaps to her
death.

Mr. Dumarae began taking students
to the opera to give them a chance to
decide for themselves whether or not
they would enjoy it. To quote Mr.
Dumarae, “Don’t accept the comments
of illiterate adults who have never
been to the opera”.

PREP GOES ON OWN

The Board of Trustees of Rutgers,
State University of New Jersey, at
their January 23, 1957 meeting, adopt-
ed resolutions which will bring about
the separation of the Preparatory
Schoo] from the University.

Dr. L. W. Jones, president of the
University, in explaining the legal
committment of the University to
devote its entire activity to public
higher education, said, “Now that the
University’s governing body has been
reorganized, it becomes imperative
that the relationship with the Prepar-
atory School be finally terminated.”

The new board of the school will be
know as the Rutgers Preparatory
School Corporation, and will assume
control of the school June 30, 1958.
Of the buildings now occupied by the
School the undisturbed use of the
Elementary School building will con-

tinue until June 30, 1958 and the
undisturbed use of the Preparatory
School buildings will continue until

June 30, 1962.

Group Arranges
Student Library

On the third floor there is a room
which has been set aside for use as
a library. Until recently no effort has
been made toward making this room
usable. Recently under the guidance of
Mrs. Wilson, Suzanne Duschock, Zena
Bernstein, Louise DiLalo, Amy Ridder-
ing and Jim Ness volunteered to put
the library in order,

Cataloguing Begins

This task was started by first cat-
aloguing every book and stamping
every book with the school name.
These cards are to be typed by Mrs.
Barnard,

The next task was to arrange the
books on the shelves. The books were
arranged into two main section, each
with sub-sections. The first section is
fiction under which comes poetry,
short stories, essays, novels, and drama.
The next section is non-fiction under
which comes biography, auto-biog-
raphy, textbooks, reference tools, col-
lege catalogues, magazines and news-
papers.

Students Take Over

After this operation is completed,
the students will take charge of the
desk, fines, Bulletin Board and gen-
eral care. In short, Rutgers Preparatory
School will have a library of which it
can be proud, and the school is cer-
tainly indebted to those who unself-
ishly gave their time so that there

 

would be a library at our disposal.

Students Will Boost YE DIAL Fund
With the Presentation of Two Plays

After observing the great care that many of our students are taking to

several pupils in Prep decided they
help the yearbook. Therefore, under
the direction of James Ness, a group
of them got together to start the job
of putting on two one act plays. By
putting on these plays, they hope to
be able to raise a small part of the
large sum of money needed for pub-
lication of our yearbook.

Honesty Is The Best Policy

The names of those taking part in
Finders Keepers, by George Kelly, are
as follows: Nancy Lee, Kirstin Kvam
and Richard Kluft. Finders Keepers is
the story of a young wife who finds
a large sum of money and does not
seem to be able to face the fact that
she must return this money to its
original owner. Finally, with the help
of her husband, Mrs. Aldred is forced
to return the money to the woman
who had lost it. This play portrays
some thoroughly human reactions in
connection with the finding of a con-
siderable sum of money, and it points
out how even relatively honest citizens
can find it difficult to be honest when
$100 is at stake.

Young Love

The shorter of the two plays is
Thursday Evening by Christopher
Morley, an emotional story about the
problems of a young married couple
who come from different backgrounds.
The play shows how these two young
people can get into a really ridiculous
quarrel, and how they can be straight-
ened out with the help of their moth-
ers, more experienced than they in
life’s problems. Joanne Milliken, Carol
Heinlein, Nancy Tomkinson and Austin
Anderson are taking the parts in this
play.

Folk Festival Wins Applause

For the first time in Prep history a
folk song festival was presented for
the students and their families at the
symnasium. On January 18 our French
and Spanish teacher Mrs. Antoinette
Rooda, Mrs. Sylvia Spath, Mr. Thomas
Rooda and fourteen selected students
combined talents. The result was a
sparkling rendition of folk songs and
dances from all over the world. The
response to this new idea was such
that a second and greater festival will
be slated for next year.

From The
Editor’s Desk

Within the past few months, the
student body at Prep has been getting
very restless during the lunch periods
and after school. To rid themselves of
excess energy, some students have been
destroying school property.

The faculty and several of the
school’s more prominent organizations
finally decided that this vandalism had
gone far enough, and, on February 15,
1957, a meeting of the faculty was
called by Mr. Heinlein. They reached
several very important decisions at
this meeting that should affect the
student body drastically.

The Student Council members and
the students are asked to co-operate
with a new program of faculty-stu-
dent supervision of all pupil behavior
from the time they come to school in
the morning until they leave it at

 

night. Several Council members will
be chosen to watch over students’
actions. Their job will be to advise

students and check up on them, not
discipline them. If any person gets
out of hand, the Council member will
be forced to report him to one of the
three faculty members who are to
supervise the committee’s actions.
These faculty members are Mrs. Wil-
son, Mr. Blake and Mr. Dumarae.

The Argo staff is determined to co-
operate with and back this new plan
to control student behavior. We all
heartily urge that the entire student
body get behind this movement and
halt this immature behavior before it
becomes habitual.

Letters to the Edito,

Dear Editor,

In the past couple of weeks, at var-
ious times, a few individuals have
caused the rest of the student body to
give up some of their rights.

The first instance of this was done
right in school, when some of the
desks and part of the stairway were
destroyed. The school did not know
exactly who did this, and so Money
was taken out of the Student Activity
fund to pay for the repairs. Now jt
seems that we may have our lunch
period shortened because a few “wise
guys” were making trouble at the
railroad station during that period.

It is obviously wrong that all the
students should have to suffer for the
trouble-making of some. No one is
against having some fun in and around
school. If people have to go around
breaking things and causing trouble
to have fun, they either have a
wharped sense of humor, or are some-
what insane.

Let us hope that the student body
won’t have to give up its time or money
any longer, because of these people.

Jon Margolis

To Whom It May Concern:

If you are interested, as I am in
Broadway hits, don’t miss Li’l Abner.
I enjoyed it fully and would like to
recommend it to Prepsters.

Li'l Abner starts in a town called
Dogpatch, a miniature place shut
away in the mountains. It concerns
the event called “Sadie Hawkins Day,”
where the women chase the men “til
the bitter end.” The whole play is
based on this important day in the
life of the people of Dogpatch. Many
amusing things happen during the
courses of the comedy—as they do in
the course of the comic strip the play
is based on.

Seeing a Broadway play is one of the

most interesting activities I know of.
I suggest that the English Depart-
ment in this school take more trips to

Plays. It would give both the teachers
and the students a break from the
same dull routine and give people a
chance to see plays they would other-
wise miss. Drama would come alive
to students who could go beyond the
printed page to the glamour of Broad-
way productions.

Pennington Beats Prepsters, 121-94.

   

SPOR TLIGHT

by Bernard Karshmer

Prep can probably be considered the
team most envolved in 100 point
games, for over the past three seasons
they have encountered three of them.
The first was three years ago while
the Prepsters were enjoying a 12
game winning streak. After thumping
Hun School by a 60-42 count at
Princeton, Coach O’Connell, in a home
encounter, let his squad rack up a
106-69 score. Last year, when the
“Little Scarlet” invaded B.M.I., their
90 point effort wasn’t enough to over-
come Bordentown’s 108 points. On
Saturday, the 23rd, Prep lost to Pen-
nington by a 121-94 count. This game
produced 5 new records.

1, Al Murasko’s old record of 40
points against Admiral Farragut in
1954 was erased when Jim Murray
tossed in 42 pts.

2, A new gym and county scoring
record was made when the two scores
added up to 215.

3, Pennington racked up an amazing
73 points a two period spread.

4, For the first time in county high
schoo] records a team (Pennington)
accumulated 100 points by the end of
the third canto.

5, Prep’s old record of a 90 point
losing performance against B.M.I. was
bettered by four,

TOM, BOB, MEL

 

On February 23, Rutgers Prep closed |}
out its regular 1956-57 basketball ;
campaign on a sorry note by losing to
Pennington Prep, 121-94. In the
highest scoring game the county has
seen in many years, many records
fell. Jim Murray established a new
school scoring record by netting 42
counters to erase Al Murasko’s mark
of 40 against Admiral Farragut in the
1953-54 campaign. Pennington’s 38
Point outburst in the second period
and the total number of points in the
game, 215, also appear to be county
scoring records.

J. V.’s Trim Pingry, 65-62

Playing against a hard fighting
Pingry five, the Prep Jay Vees won
65 to 62 in overtime.

The Pingry team jumped out to a
commanding lead by ball hawking and
fast breaks. The Prep team could not
seem to get going and was stymied
until the beginning of the third
quarter. Then they caught hold of
themselves and started cutting down
the Pingry lead. With about a minute
to go, down by two points, the Prep
five held the ball for one shot, and
then Dean Kamm made a spectacular
drive for the two points just as the
buzzer sounded. Prep got three points
in overtime to win the game. The Jay
Vees posted an 8 and 7 record with
a few more games to go.

Ronnie, Jimmy and Bruce Head For A Score.

It was a nip and tuck battle for the
first eight minutes with Prep on the
low end of a 27- 25 score at the buzz-
er. At the outset of the second quarter,
Pennington, led by All-Stater Marv
Trotman, clicked for 9 straight points
to move in front 36-25. This string
was broken by Jackowitz’s deuce but
the Group IV quintet poured on the
steam to outscore Jackowitz, Murray
& Co. by a 38-14 count to lead 65-39
at intermission.

The second half told quite a dif-
ferent story. Coach O'Connell's forces
matched Pennington basket for basket
with Murray and Piscatelli showing
the way, but the big deficit which
Trotman & Co. had amassed during
the second canto was too great for
the Prepsters to overcome. The final
score was 121-94, the “Little Scarlet”
missing the century mark by only 6
points themselves.

Ronnie, Andy Score High.

Murray was aided in the scoring
column by Ron Jackowitz who clicked

for 27 and Andy Piscatelli who hit
for 12. This raised Ronnie’s season
total to 478 while increasing his 3

year total to 1034. Andy, who also has
scored consistently in double figures,
was the key man in rebounding.

The “Little Scarlet” who have now
finished the regular season with a
11-10 record will be gunning for vic-
tory number 12 in the finals of the
Headmaster’s Tournament.

Correspondence News

To all the recent graduates of Prep:

I am writing this letter to ask you
what subject or activity you had in
Prep which you feel has benefited you
most in college. I would like very much
if you would express your opinions
and send them to the Argo. Also in-
cluded in your opinion could be any
subject or activity which did not ben-
efit you at all.

The Argo has a special reason for
wanting your opinions. After a select
group of staff members compiles a list
of the activities, we can establish a
standard. From this standard, students
will be able to judge what will profit
them in high school and later on in
college.

We are sorry to hear about the
accident which John Kuhthau was in.
We all hope that he will recover soon.

Both students and faculty send their
best wishes to Virginia Riegger
who was married February 9. She will
reside in Philadelphia and plans to
finish her education at Drexel.

Roger Seamon, who is in the class
of 1959 at Yale, is a candidate for a
Bachelor of Arts degree in one of
Yale’s special programs. Roger should
also be congratulated for making the
Dean’s list.

If there are any alumni who have
accomplished something that they or
their friends and relatives think worth
mentioning, we are always appreciative
of such news. Just drop us a letter,
and we will print your news so that
the Prepsters who follow you will see
what they can accomplish.

CLUB NEWS

by V. E. Stilwell

This year the Ye Dial staff has been
working efficiently and the yearbook
is coming along quickly.

Bernard Karshmer, our
Manager, has succeeded in
for last year’s advertising
collected more than the estimated
amount of advertising for the 1957
year. Since we do have a large sum of
money to help pay for our advertising,
there will not have to be a large
amount of money taken out of the
Student Activities Fund.

The design and layout of Ye Dial
are probably the longest part of the
yearbook construction. Vic Stilwell, the
Layout and Design Editor, has insti-
tuted a change in the cover for 1957.

To meet a deadline, we must have
a certain number of pages drawn up,
have the copy written, and the pic-
tures developed and printed so that we
may send them with the page layouts.

The photography for the yearbook
does not cost the school too much
since Fred Schatzman takes and de-
velops approximately thirty prercent
of the pictures. The Academy Year-
book Photographers take the balance
of the pictures.

The writing in the yearbook is under
the control of Florence Schmitt. Her
job extends from the beginning of the
school year until the last deadline is
met.

The entire staff work is under the
control of Joe Messina, the Editor-in-
Chief, and Mrs. Rooda, our advisor.

CHEM CLUB TAKES TRIP

The Chem Club and the Advanced
Chem Club will take their trip on
February 28, to the Consumer’s Union
Research Laboratory in Washington,
New Jersey.

The trip was originally planned by
the Chem Club for a date soon after
examinations. The Club even started
on the trip to Washington, but, due
to the heavy snow and_ hazardous
driving conditions, they decided it
would be best to return and postpone
the trip.

The two clubs will take this trip
together and another one to the Esso
refineries later in the year. Mr. Daviet
will accompany the students.

Mr. Dumarae Forms
A Discussion Group

On a recent Thursday Mr. Dumarae
called a meeting of a small group of
students in his room during the activ-
ities period. These few pupils were
then informed of the formation of a
new club, which would be a discussion
and study class.

This new organization will meet on
Thursday to discuss topics of a wide
and varied nature. The first meeting
was hold to determine two things;
first, to ascertain whether the selected
students would be interested in the
forming of the club; and_ secondly,
to see what type of topics appeal to
the group for future study and dis-
cussion. The topics brought up were
religions, poetry, art, music, and the
Bible among many others. The Bible
was selected, and the Book of Ruth
has been assigned for study and debate.

The club will be informal in opera-
tion, with no set rules or officers. Mr.
Dumarae will be the group’s adviser,
helping to get projects rolling, and
will act as chairman for the present
time.

The membership will be limited to
students recognized as hard workers.
To become a member, one must be
recommended and approved at a meet-
ing. In every case, however, the final
judgement and acceptance must come
from Mr. Dumarae, with whom the
decision rests.

Music Appreciation Group Formed

Already formed is the Music Appre-
ciation group, which is also function-
ing under the leadership of Mr. Du-
marae. This group meets on Mondays
for the purpose of listening to good
music. The greater part of its program
will be devoted to music of the clas-

sical type, but occassionally show
music and jazz will be heard.
At the first meeting, a piece by

Bach was played, and a recorder was
examined.

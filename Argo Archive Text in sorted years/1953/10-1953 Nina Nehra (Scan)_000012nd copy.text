School Adds
Extra Period
For Clubwork

A change in the schedule has
given our student body five extra
activity periods a week. These pe-
riods are devoted to the extra-
curricular activities of the school.
The present activities are not new
to the school but new activities
may be organized in the near fu-
ture. With the exception of the
Glee Club, the different groups
may participate in any, or all of
the groups, for there is no conflict
between them. The students not
participating in the activity of the
day, have a well supervised study
period,

On Monday, the group working
on “Ye Dial” has their meetings.
The “Ye Dial”, which is our school
year book, is supervised by its
faculty adviser, Mr. Gaggini. All
the writing ete, is done by the
students. I am sure, with the stu-
dent backing and this extra time,
the “Ye Dial’, will be a book to
be proud of this year.

On Tuesday and Thursday the
Glee Club meets with Mr. Duma.
rae, the director of the Club. This
organization is the oldest and most
impressive in the school, so it is

Sports Flash
Long Branch, Oct. 19: Rutgers

Prep scored a great moral victory |:

over Long Branch High School by
tying them, 2-2, in a brillrant soc-
cer game.

Stu Edelberg scored two goals to
raise his goal-producing total to
five goals in four games. He has
been our offensive standout so far
this year .

With 30 seconds left to play,
fullback Joe Horowitz saved the
game by getting a foot on a ball

gratified to find that the student
body is in favor of our party. Our
platform will be carried out to the
best of the council’s ability with
the students’ support.”

Don Hughes, the defeated candi-
‘date, said, “Although my entire
party succumbed to defeat, we will
back our former rivals to the fullest
extent for the benefit of the
school.” In their campaigns, both
parties revealed good management,
competence, sportsmanship, and a
keen desire for the betterment of
the school, regardless of personal
victories,

Both parties presented their
platforms last Friday during ac-
tivity period. Both stressed the
importance of cooperation from
the members of the student body
and close alliance with the faculty.
Possible outings and excursions
were also mentioned.

The program began with com-
ments made by Mr. Holly concern-
ing the spirit and nature of elec-
tions. Manager Bernard Cohn in-
troduced his candidates with a
brief comment about each, and
ealled the nominees to the rostrum.
One of the day’s most vigorous
speeches was delivered by John
Kuhlthau, who compared a cooper-
ative student body with an active
drill team, each person being in
perfect step and harmony. The em-
phasis was on harmony and cooper-
ation. Elfriede Riddering spoke
of plans to visit the United Nations
some time in the future. John Rosa
campaigned for the return of stu-
dent administration day, when the
seniors would take over the school.
Stuart Edelberg stressed integra-
tion of students and student rep-
resentatives. Si

Then Weston Merritt, manager of
the Cavalier party, introduced his
candidates. Their speeches were
short and to the point, with each
nominee promising his full sopport .
toward organized activity.

First Edition

Students and Faculty: This is it,
our first edition. The whole field
of newspaper work on a larger
scale is new to all of us, Many
thanks should be given to all the
staff who pioneered for us.

The new size paper we think
looks much more representative
of a preparatory school than the
former size, and regular printing
will be more popular than photo

ofiset.

One thing that we want to make
clear is that the paper is to be run
by the entire school and not just
a chosen few. Any ideas that you
may have will be entertained by
the staff. If you want to write up
your whims, Letters to the Editor
will be accepted and published.

In order that you may find your
special interests in the paper
readily, here is the outline of the
editions. The first page contains
news and special sports flashes.
Page two is devoted to editorials
and in the future perhaps an in-
quiring reporter. Page three will
contain a by line of sports and
write ups of all the sporting
events, Page four is made up of
lower school news and continued
articles,

Letters to the
Dear Editor:

The task of educating young peo-
ple so that they may take their re-
spective places in an ever-changing
world is one of unbelievable mag-
nitude, It present a real challenge
to the schools of America because
of the rapid pace of development in
all subjects, and because of the
great variety of pranches of knowl-
edge, One of the greatest assets to
a school for meeting the vontem-
porary needs of the student is an
adequate library.

It is indeed unfortunate that
Prep has such ‘a poor library
the school at the present time. How-
ever, I know that the students have
‘access to the university library aft-
er school hours. Why can’t we take
advantage of study-hall time to
visit the library?

I know that there are few teach-
ers in school who assign actual ref-
erence work, but many students
come across some interesting facts
that they would like to know more
about. If Prep students are given
permission to g0 out of study-hall
to the library, they will have an
opportunity to become acquainted
with it and learn to get the most
out of it by actual use.

The library situation in Frep now
is shameful. In the study-hall we
have two sets of encyclopedias, a
few other reference books, and one
dictionary. The other pooks are in
the office and more than half of
the student body do not know that
they exist. : a.

The addition of library privileges
during study-halls is one way of
giving the student every possible
opportunity towards getting a well-
rounded viewpoint of the econtem-
porary world he lives in,

NORMAN KARSHMER
Two Prep graduates showed the
way as Rutgers defeated V. P. I.

last Saturday. Ken Bossow, former
tackle, and Bruce Johnson, former

victory, both on offense and de-
fense. . .

The Prep soccer team looked
fair in its first outing against Pin-
gry. Prep’s play was ragged but
taking into consideration that most
of the boys had never played the
improve ‘with experience our out.
game before, and that they should
look is brighter. A few of the boys
looked goon on defense but the
lack of a good kicking full-back
is still Coach O'’Connell’s biggest
problem. ...

The players that caught my eye
at the game were Bernie Cohn,
John Kulthau, Jerry Kamm, and
Stu Edefberg. Of this group, Jerry
is tHe Teast experienced but played
a good game at half-back. Joe
Horowitz, Dave Buchine, Charlie
Martorelli, Joe Messina, and Al
Murasko are all coming along and
will aid the team on Oct, 14 when
they meet Wardlaw School at
Plainfield. ». .

The Varsity “R” Club has picked
its officers for the 1953-54 school
year. Len Bartlett was elected
president, Bob Allen vice-presi-
dent, and Norm Karschmer sec-
retary-treasurer. Bill Kurtz and
Al Murasko were voted in the
club at its last meeting. -..

 

VARSITY ‘R’ CLUB

The Varsity “R” Club is now
making plans for an Alumni
basketball game to be held on
Dec, 29. All of the basketball play-
ers who have played in the last
five years are invited to play. An
informal dance will follow the
game and will be sponsored by
the Varsity “R” Club.

Quote & Unquote

The following are expressions
heard on the bus coming back
from the Pingry game-

Mike Kessler and Howard To-
bin: “Doesn’t anyone have an
opener?”

Tono Rebollo: “Just one drag,”

Stu Edelberg: “I sure played a
great game today?”

ketball team very badly this year

Coach O’Connell.

A manager at the Rutgers Pre-
paratory Schoo] is not just a slave
to the player’s every whim but is
a respected member of an athletic
team. A good manager can often
mean the success of a team or its
defeat. A manager get to know the
players on the team and the other
people in school while he meets
new people on team trips. He gets
to know officials and opposing
coaches very well and is respected
by them as a vital part of the team.

The Rutgers Prep soccer team routed Wardlaw School 3-1 in a

The contest was favored by ideal weather conditions.

Prep drew first blood on a pass from right wing, Bill Muhs, to Stu

Rugged Sporting
Season Foreseen

This year we have one of the
longest and hardest basketball
schedules that the school has seen
in a few years, The teams added
to the schedule are Peddie, Ad-
miral Farragut, and Totenville.

Len Bartlett will be the only
starter from last years’ team, Last
year Don Hughes came back from
Lawrenceville to play in the last
few games and should be a great
asset to the team. Bob Allen, an
agile forward, should bolster the
depth of the team. Two new com-
ers to Prep, who should do a great
deal in basketball, are Bill Kurtz
of Hoffman High in South Amboy,
and Al Murasco of South River,
who made All-County last year.

We have an alumni game during
Christmas vacation composed of
Prep’s outstanding players from
1948-53. John Houseman, Prep’s
former coach who left us to coach
in Euing High, will direct the al-
umni if he can take the time off.

This year we would like to have
many students come to the games
and support our teams when they

 

go into battle.

Prep had won its first game to
reach the 500 mark.

Stu Edleberg has now brought
his goal producing effort to three
goals. He played a fine game on
both offences and defence from
his right inside position. John
Kuhlthau, center half back, was
another offensive and defensive
standout, Although he didn’t score
four of John’s kicks from the fifty
yard line were taken on one
bounce by the opposing goalie.
Dave Buchine and Bernie Cohn
also played a good game while
Charlie Martorelli was our defen-
sive standout in the goalie posi-
tion.

This year is the second year
that soccer has been a major sport
at the Rutgers Preparatory school.
Mr. Dick O’Connell, or “Coach,”
as he is known to many students
in school, played soccer when he
was in high school and college
and he is now coaching our squad.

The 1953 soccer team opened its
season October 6, against Pingry,
and dropped the decision, 3-1. This
game was played on a rainy day,
and the two teams played at an
even best, but a penalty kick was
the turning point for Pingry. Stu
Edelberg, a junior in school, scored
our only goal. Jerry Kamm, John
Kuhlthau, and Charlie Martorelli
all played a good defensive game.

College?

The October 17th issue of the
“Saturday Evening Post” contained
an article of interest to all stu-
dents of Rutgers Prep, entitled “So
You Want to Go to College.” This
article, written by Robert U. Jame-
son, an experienced counselor of
students, explains the necessary
procedures for successful applica-
tion to any college.

High school seniors should, as
quickly as possible, settle on their
educational aims, their reasons for
going to college, and which college

cers and visit colleges whenever
possible. Most important’ of all,
make applications for entrance ex-
laminations to be taken in January.
In January and February one
should file application for admis-
sion and for examinations, if this
has not been done before. All
through the year, seniors should
strive for the best possible marks,
stay out of disciplinary trouble,
and contribute as much as possible
to their school’s welfare.

In present times, admission to
college is on a highly competitive

oe

basis because most colleges are |

overcrowded. Some have as many
as three to ten applicants for every
opening, Therefore, a senior must
show a good scholastic record in
thigh school, An A or B average
is ideal. “The candidate must show
evidence of the ability to do college
work.” Not only are 12th-grade
marks important, but also 11th and
10th grade marks. Serious impor-
tance is also'attached to good char-
acter, since. most colleges estimate
the promise of a student not only

from his scholastic record but also }
from his character, personality, and }

seriousness of purpose.

One should also decide quite
definitely what the reason is for
attending college. If you want to
go to college to improve your mind,
to really learn something, to ac-
quire culture, then you will prob-
ably reap a great many of the ben.
efits of college. A well-rounded life,
with basic knowledge as its root,
is one of the greatest gifts of col-
lege. And with this comes matur-
ity, self-reliance, and confidence,
all of which can be had in a good
college education.

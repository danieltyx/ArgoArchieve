Form School
AFS Group

Since December of 1960, the
Rutgers Preparatory School Stu-
dent Council has been investi-
gating the possibilities of insti-
tuting in this school a Student
Exchange Program. Under such
a program, a foreign student
might study here for one school
year, living with an American
family.

 

Board of Trustees Forms Committees;

Development of Campus Discussed
The Board of Trustees, working in conjunction
with the faculty, is now studying the Elm Farm
Campus. Accordingly, they are discussing plan for
fund raising for the development of the campus
buildings and playing fields, as well as the pur-
chasing of equipment.

The development of the fields has been given
priority due to the length of time that it takes to
get them in condition for playing,

Committees Study Plans

The Board and the Faculty of the School have
been broken up into committees. Some are purely
on a discussion basis; others have already been set
into motion. The groups are as follows: the Policy
and Planning Committee, the Space Needs Com-
mittee, the Gymnasium Committee and the Stu-
dent Center Committee.

 

Discusses Plans for Elm Farm Campus

The Board of Trustees of Rutgers Preparatory School met in February to discuss its
plans concerning the new campus at Elm Farm.

After this, a student from the
school might spend the summer
in a foreign country. Corres-
Pondence has been maintained
with the American Field Service,

The Rudolfs Memorial Library Committee,
with the help of the Parents Association, has
already begun acquisition of books for the library.
However, the proposal for a Student Center, where
students would gather for arts, music and other
extra-curricular activities, is strictly on a discus-
sion basis.

All these committees report to the Board of

Trutees through major committees called the
Steering and Financing Committees.

Results of Self-Study
The committees are also studying the results
of the self-examination of the School, carried out
over the past three years for the Middle States
Association of Colleges and Secondary School. By
Spring the committees hope to have a definite idea
about the concrete plans for the new campus.

Support Kennedy's Bill
For Public Education

_ Currently under dispute is the Kennedy Administra-
tion’s program for federal aid to education. The program
which would include grants to states for public elemen-
tary and secondary education, loans to colleges for con-
struction, and grants for college scholarships has been
assailed for its failure to aid non-public institutions and
especially parochial schools.

The arguments that are now being exchanged have
nothing too do with partisan politics. Indeed the whole
question is a constitutional problem and not a moral
eae as some of the President’s critics seem to sug-

BILL OF RIGHTS...

Article I of the Bill of Rights clearly states
“Congress shall make no law respecting an_ estab
ment of religion.” Legally, therefore, the President’s
position is completely sound.

Education is primarily a community problem. If the
community cannot ‘handle it, the state assume the
burfden. When both the community and the state can
no longer manage it, the federal government has the
right to intervene.

... STATES LIMITS...

Clearly the federal government must only subsidize
public’ education programs which can not be supported
wholly on the ‘local or evén the state level.

The current argument is centered around aid to
parochial schools; however, the question concerns all
private institutions. No child in America need go without
an education, but should the child be withdrawn volun-
tarily from the public school system, it is no longer the
duty of the government to pay for his schooling.

. . . IN ARTICLE ONE

Critics have argued thaat no child should be denied
federal assistance because his parents have chosen to-
give him a God-centered education. Again we repeat, for
we feel that it is of paramount importance, that the
government has neither the right nor the duty to sub-
sidize private school systems. :

We of The Argo support the administration’s pro-
gram. The future of America depends upon sound educa-
tion programs. We must agree with Secretary of Health,
Education, and Welfare Abraham Ribicoff that federal
aid to non-public schools would be “most tragic.”

Students Must Pick
From Many Activities

One of the greatest problems which confronts a
student who has a sincere interest in Prep and its activ-
ities is the great number of worthwhile activities from
which to choose. One would like to join this club or
another, work on a publication, play a sport. Now, in
spring, the problern becomes more accute.

DIVERSITY IN...

Consider the activites offered at this time. As usual
publications are active; Ye Dial putting out its supple-
ment, and The Argo working on subsequent issues. La-
crosse and Baseball teams take up hours in the after-
noon. Gym activities, tennis, and girls’ basketball are
popular. The Argomag is also being produced.

. . » EXTRACURRICULARS

Even the Glee Club which in past years had been
disbanded after the Christmas Concert this year con-
tinues its work. To cap off this fever pitch of activities,
the school play has been chosen and tryouts are at hand.
What does the student do who wants to do too much?

There is only one solution which in reality does not
end the problem: the student must choose the activities

which he most enjoys.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Calls for More Information

Dear Editor,

‘The Student Council's new project on Foreign Aid and Foreign
students has not sufficiently been brought to the attention of the

student body.
Student

I have noticed a great interest in this subject; students often

discuss it among themselves and
try to find out more about it.
I do not feel that the Class
Delegates are reporting this mat-
ter to their respective classes as
clearly and extensively as they
should.

Delegate Reports
‘The delegate system has been
established not only for the ben-
efit of the individual but for
the benefit of the entire class.

Why hayen’t Student Council
minutes continued to be passed
out? These were a major source
of Council information. They
provided simply and briefly the
essential goings on in the Coun-
cil, I am sure that if they were
again mimeographed the student
body would have more of its
questions answered,

Students Want Information

If more participation on the
part of the student body is ex-
pected, the Council should keep
it better informed. How can
anyone decide sensibly on an
issue about which he has scanty
information? The student body
is interested and would appreci-
ate more information,

In the past few years our ath-

records in, almost every sport. In
game after game we are both out-

It seems to me that our biggest
problem is that most of our op-
ponents are schools with far
larger enrollments than Prep,
When we do compete with schools
whose size is close to ours we do
better than hold our own.
However, we do not belong in

entirely to her brother, and who then is left alone when he goes off
to get married. But this was marred by Miss Stapleton’s performance,

On Saturday, March 4, students from the French classes, accom~-
panied by Mr. Alfred Gaggini and Mr, Thomas Dumarae, went to
the New York City Center to see the “Comedie Francaise” produc-
tion of “Britannicus.”
One of Jean Racine’s great 1th century tragedies, “Britannicus”
is the story of the Roman Emperor, Nero, and his downfall through
love, jealousy, and greed for power.
Nero and Britannicus were brothers by different marriages, and
their mother, Agrippina, put Nero on the throne so that she would
have some power. When she began to lose influence over him she tried
to put Britannicus into power. °
The whole play shows this struggle, as well as the struggle that
results from the eternal love triangle: Nero and Britannicus are in
love with the game girl, Junie, but she loves only Britannicus.

Cagers End On High Note

‘The Rutgers Prep swimming and basketball teams both ended
thelr regular seasons with fine performances. The mermen toppled
the Hun School 48-38, while the hoopsters lost to Hoffman High
School in a much closer game than the final score of 62-44

indicates.

The victory over Hun enabled the Argonaut natators to hike’
their record up to 3-3-1 and to finish the season with a .500
percentage. Prep winners in the Hun meet were Greg DeVido,

Zirpolo; Jack McCormick; and

victory seemed to be close within
the grasp of the Argonaut cag-
ers. With Paul Gottlieb and Leo
Motiuk pouring in points, Dave
Weiss dominating the boards,
and Rich Patt and Jack Mc-
Cormick turning in stellar de-
fensive performances, the hoop-
sters raced out to an early lead
and held it until midway
through the third pei

At this point Weiss injured
his back and had to leave the
game. The cagers who never
really recovered from this loss,
quickly fell behind and finally
Jost by eighteen points.

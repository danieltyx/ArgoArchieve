She Sincerity

of Baby

Older folks are influenced—and
rightly so—by the advice and ex-
perience of physicians and nurses
who have endorsed Johnson's Baby
Powder. But baby’s praise is told
in smiles and chuckles.

 

Johnson's is so deliciously cooling
and so fondly comforting—a sooth-
ing balm to that most vexing thing
called skin. hi

We suggest this motto to mothers
who want scientific quality and
money’s-worth quantity in any
article—“Try the drug store first.”

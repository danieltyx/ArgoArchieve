Holiday Program

by Linda Levy

The students of Prep anticipate that
this year’s Glee Club Concert will be
one of the best ever given. The con-
cert will be performed at the Rutger’s
Prep gymnasium on the 14th of De-
cember. Rehearsals have been going on
since the beginning of the school year,

and as the concert approaches, they
are being extended to after school
meetings.

REHEARSALS IN PROGRESS

The Glee Club meets and rehearses
under the competent direction of Mrs.
Durkee and Mr. Dumarae, the Glee
Club advisor. Mrs. Durkee teaches and
leads us in each song while Nancy
Haworth accompanies on the piano.

The program has a Christmas theme.
Some of the more tuneful songs the
Glee Club will sing are: “Little Christ
Child, Sweet and Holy;” “Carol of the
Little King;” “I Saw Three Ships;” and
“Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones.” An
Elementary Schoo] group will sing a
number of and will be
audience participation in a few songs.

Council Delegates
Attend Conference

By Danylo Struk

On November 15, the New Jersey
Association of High School Councils
met at Rutgers University for the
thirty-first annual conference. The
theme for this convention was: “Better
Student Councils for Better Human
Relations.”

There were representatives of student
councils of almost all schools in New
Jersey. Rutgers Prep was represented
by three of the officers of the student
council; Steve Hancox, Bernard Karsh-
mer, and Danny Struk.

SPEECHES BEGIN CONFERENCE

The program of the day started at
10:30 A.M. with a General Session in
the Rutgers Gymnasium. Here we heard
an interesting speech by Governor
Robert B. Meyner which ended as a
sort of “press conference.” We also
heard a magnificent address by Dr.
Mason W. Gross, Provost of Rutgers
University.

After this each one of our delegates
went to a Problem Clinic where many
interesting topics were discussed. After
lunch the three of us attended a Dis-
cussion Meeting on how to run a stu-
dent council meeting. All this informa-
tion proved to be very valuable.

At the Closing Session we heard the
best speech of the day by Mr. Coleman

 

together

Brown.

 

 

lost School Constitution

KEY CLUB SUBMITS ITS IDEAS
FOR FINAL STUDENT APPROVAL

Some time ago the school constitu-
tion disappeared, and we have been
operating without one ever since. Re-
cently, Mr. Heinlein found a copy of
an older constitution and it was agreed
that we would work from that. This
old constitution lacks reference to our
present way of electing officers to the
Student Council and to class represen-
tation in the Student Council.

CLASSES MEET

Several weeks ago, class meetings
were held for the purpose of amending
the constitution. Each student was
provided with a copy of the old con-
stitution to make the task easier.
Strangely, the eighth grade made no
amendments and the most common
amendment proposal was a changed
class representation in the Student
Council. The Secretary of each class
wrote up the proposed amendments
and submitted them to the Key Club.

KEY CLUB GOES TO WORK

The Key Club went right to work
with the material presented to it from
the class secretaries. All the amend-
ments were listed. The Key Club also
wrote in its opinions to the proposed
amendments and some proposed
amendments of its own.

The Key Club presented the amend-
ments to Mr. Heinlein. The amendments
will undergo faculty approval and
those approved will be presented to
each student for his approval.

Amendments which are voted in by
the student body will be adopted for
the constitution. The new constitution
will be larger and much more com-
plete.

P.A.S.S. Conference

The second annual meeting of the
Press Association of Secondary Schools
was presented at Perth Amboy High
School. The Argo sent three represent-
atives to this conference on December
8. The purpose of this meeting was to
compare ideas that other school news-
paper staffs of this area have.

At the conference there were sev-
eral discussion groups to analyze prob-
lems of the various staffs represented.
Our editor led one of these discussion
clinics dealing with the censorship in
school newspapers. Louise DiLalo and
Peter Wintersteiner also represented
our school at the conference.

From The
Editor’s Desk

In the Spring of this year, the ARGO
will publish Prep’s school magazine,
the ARGO-MAG. This magazine used
to be a bi-annual magazine until last
year. The lack of interest on the part
of the student body caused us to limit
the MAG to a yearly edition. This year
the same policy will be continued ex-
cept — we are going to try to enlarge
the MAG.

In order for us to even publish the
magazine, we need your help. In the
MAG, many types of literature written
by the student body is presented. The
writing can be a theme, a assigned or
free, book reports, essays or poems.
The piece of writing must be worthy
of publication, and a recommendation
of your English teacher is preferable.

 

Whenever you have something you
wish to submit for the ARGO-MAG,
please read it carefully, correct any

errors and then turn it over to your
English teacher. When the staff re-
cieves your article, we will act on it
as soon as possible.

Incidentally, for those of you who
prided yourselves in the letter to the
editor concerning the amount of home-
work, I must inform you that when
we recieved the original letter, it need-
ed more proof reading than any arti-
cle ever presented to the ARGO, show-
ing the writer needed even more home-
work.

 

FLASH —

There will bea dance at the PREP

The attire is semi-formal. Dancing
and games will be offered.

Letters to the Edit

Dear Editor,

Just lately there has ;
controversy about fies quite a

these people realize the end which ao
are hoping to gain. If oyy wot

present. To give us more daily hom
work would mean that we would a
a minimum of relaxation for fiye ae
a week. A trite old saying Boes, “Ay
work and no play makes Jack a dull
boy.” This is just the case. By the
time Saturday arrived we would be in
a state of mental exhaustion — too
tired to enjoy ourselves.

Perhaps this is an exaggeration, but
I think not. At the present time few
of us have complaints, and this seems
to be logical. As things stand we have
leisure each day, and on weekends, Of
prime importance is the fact that we
did not come to Prep to play, and 1
think most of us agree on that point.
I propose that we leave things as they
are.

To the editor:

Many of the boys at Rutgers Prep
have expressed a dislike of the rule
which makes wearing jackets and ties
to school every day compulsory.

I admit that the wearing of jackets
and ties tends to make the student
body appear neat and uniform, but I
am sure that the personal pride of the
students would keep them (the stu-
dents) looking neat and presentable, if
they were allowed to dress more cas-
ually The wearing of jackets and ties

   

 

is not necessary to make us look like
college preparatory students; most col-
leges allow their students to attend
classes in casual clothes.

Some of the boys at Rutgers Prep
feel that they would be more at case

if they didn’t have to wear jackeis and
ties to class; they might be more
active in discussions and be able
concentrate better on classroom work,
if they were allowed to dress casually
and comfortably.

When the weather is rainy, snowy.
very hot, or very cold, dressing would
be much more convenient if jackets
and ties were not mandatory.

I suggest that the student council
sees if anything could be done towards
the changing of this rule, as soon as
Possible.

SPOR {LIGHT

by Bernard Karshmer

Now that our dismal soccer season,
and I mean dismal (0-8-1), has drawn

to a close, all eyes will be focussed on|-

pasketball. As in past years the Little
Scarlet hoopsters prospects look better
than average. By average I mean 14
wins against 7 loses. . . Of course Prep
will miss high scoring Marty Metzger,
who piled up an amazing 527 points;
put from here it looks as though new-
comer, Ron Jackowitz, and returning
letterman, Andy Piscatelli, will be able,
to some extent, offset the loss of Metz-
ger. Sharpshooting Jim Murray looks
like the kind of ball player that’s al-
ways nice to have around. He not only
has deadly set and jump shots, but
also is one of our best rebounding
prospects. Bruce Gunkle and Joe Mes-
sina are aiming for the other two
starting berths. The other boys on the
squad are Dave Stephen, Jim Durkin,
Jim Burke, “Monkey” Feldman, Bob
Smith, and Dean Kamm.

Friday’s game against St. Mary’s
(S.A.) ought to be a good one. It is
never a push over. It will be played
on the home hardwood.

The Little Scarlet J.V.’s, if they are
as good as they are estimated to be
should end they best record in many
a year.

Let’s all get out and back the team
in the first and in every game.

Varsity Starters, Murray, Piscatelli

On November 28, the Rutgers Prep
basketball team traveled to Sacred
Heart School to encounter Coach Jake
Bornheimer’s St. Peters quintet. The
“Little Scarlet” played exceedingly well,
going home contented with their fine
showing against the runners-up in the
Catholic A Division Tournament last
year.

The whole team which includes Ron
Jackowitz, Andy Piscatelli, Bruce
Gunkle, Jimmy Murray, Jim Durkin,
Dave Stephens, “Monk” Feldman and
Joe Messina, made the trip. Unfor-
tunately, ex-St. Peters dribbler, Jimmy

J. V.’s Expect Better Season

This year a new coach has come to
the school to coach the Jay Vees. Al
Murasko, a former Prep great, has taken
over the job which Mr. Speduto had
handled for several years.

The team shows good promise, for
many of the boys who will play on the
Jay Vee played on the team the year
before. Because of this, they have that
needed game experience. Some of the
boys who will play this year are, Jimmy
Racz, Bobby Cox, Irv Quakenboss,
Frank Hof, Steven Holsten, Melvin
Hamelsky and some under-classmen
who play on the varsity squad.

Last year the Junior Varsity didn’t
have much of a season but this year
it hopes to improve on its last years
record.

to scrimmaging his old “buddies” took
ill; Bobby Fazekas and Max Kamm,
also, were unavailable for the afternoon.

The Prepsters wasted no time in
taking lead over their next door en-
emies. Ron Jackowitz and Jimmy Mur-
ray, continuously drove through the
Petrean defense for lay-ups and easy
jumpers around the key; when the
defense collapsed, both ripped the cords
with deadly sets. Joe Messina and Bruce
Gunkle also hit well from the outside
to contribute to the fall of the St.
Peter’s zone. Andy Piscatelli was es-
sential in rebounding and scored fre-
quently on jump shots around the key.

On defense, the story was much the
same. Prep dominated the backboards
and early in the game tallied numer-
ous fast breaks with Jackowitz, Gunkle
and Messina on the scoring end. Monk
Feldman and Jimmy Durkin proved
good hawkers while Dave Stevens was
sweeping the boards along with Murray
and Piscatelli to stop Staggard, Criss,
and Co, cold.

When the game ended the Prepsters
appeared confident of another success-
ful season. Although no sores were kept
and individual points were not tabulat-
ed, Managers Hancox and Rackmill
reported a clear-cut Prep victory. They
disclosed that the “Little Scarlet” had
won by about 30 points and imagined
Jackowitz and Murray netted 30 apiece
with Piscatelli, Messina and Gunkle
not far behind.

War And Peace
Has Its Debut

War and Peace is one of the longest
and most spectacular movies ever made
and it certainly is long. There are
more people, horses, chariots, and
scenery in this picture than in just
about any other and more minutes too.
But after sitting through all this splen-
dor for four hours, you begin to wonder
where it gets you.

THE GAY LIFE

The first half of the picture is the
peace part. There’s a war going on but
it is far away, and nobody really cares
about wars that are far away. The
picture opens in Moscow. Things are
great especially if your rich, as the
people whom we see are. Everybody
lives in splendor and the picture is
full of beautiful dancers and fox hunts,
of people falling in and out of love,
drinking and dueling and _ enjoying
themselves in general. The acting is
very good, especially Audrey Hepburn,
who runs around the whole picture
with a smile and a low cut dress. In
fact, everything is very beautiful, but
it doesn’t go anyplace. Even that
wouldn’t be so bad but two hours of
standstill can get a little boring.

BLOOD AND GORE

Then we come to the second half,
when Napolian’s army invades Moscow.
This part doesn’t get anywhere either,
but it has so many interesting things,
such as, people dying and men wound-
ed, and bloody and shot, and the
French army getting masacred and
dying like flies, as they tramp through
the snow, and the little episode, where
a soldier opens the door of a coach
and out falls a beautiful lady frozen-
solid (Product of Birds Eye Inc.)

War and Peace is a great spectacle.
The acting is superb and the scenery
is wonderful. It presents an int
picture of how war effects an aristoc-
racy. One just wonders if its worth the
time.

‘Columbia Presents

The Aviation Club is on the wing | fits 33rd Contest
b

this year and meets on Thursdays. Bo
Cox is the president and Mr. Moffat
is the advisor. Twelve boys are active
in the club.

Each meeting two boys are assigned
to report on different phases of avia-
tion, with a discussion following. At
the meetings Mr. Moffat explains the
different parts of an airplane, how to
navigate a plane, and how to prepare
for a license.

At the beginning of the schoo] year
the group went on a flying trip to
learn elementary maneuvers and
straight flying. The group plans to do
some cross country flying in the near
future.

THE CHEM CLUB

The members of the Chem Club have
shown quite an interest in the activ-
ities of their club. The club meets
during activities period on Wednesdays,
to explore the field of Chemistry
further than class periods will permit.
President Martin Levowitz opens the
meetings and explains the experiment
which the club will take part in. All
experiments are arranged by the plan-
ning committee, Sally Searls, Jennifer
Upton, Richard Conrad, and Louise
DiLalo, who are headed by Arlene
Greenberg, vice-president of the club.
Barbara Lipman is the club's secretary.
Everyone enjoyed making bouncing
putty, synthetic rubber, hand lotion
and hydrogen peroxide, or, to quote
Martin Levowitz, “Sally Searls’ hair
tonic.”

 

CLASS PARENTS MEET

During November, evening confer-
ences were held for the parents of
Rutgers Preparatory School Students.

The three main discussions were:
changing aspects of secondary educa-
tion, purposes of the school’s guidance
program, and Mr. Heinlein spoke to
the senior parents about the problems
concerning college admission.

Every teacher spoke with the classes
they teach. Parents had many ques-
tions in regards to the marking system,
class discussions, and conduct of the
students. All of these questions were
well answered by our faculty along
with personal problems.

Many new students have come to
Rutgers Preparatory this semester, and
their parents had an ideal opportunity
to meet our instructors and see our
school.

This year the Argo is going to be
entered in the 33rd Annual Contest for
school newspapers, sponsored by the
Columbia Scholastic Press Association.

The Columbia Scholastic Press Asso-
ciation, found in 1925, is an organiza-
tion of school publications sponsored
by Columbia University. There is a
governing board which is composed of
about thirty men and women who have
had experience in the student publica-
tions field.

The newspapers are entered in the
contest and are read and rated by the
Board of Judges. With each newspaper
entered, a booklet in which the scoring
of the Judges, based on a range of
1,000 points together with critical and
helpful comments, may be found.

Normally it takes about four to six
weeks to score the newspapers after
the convention is over, then the results
are mailed to the various schools.

Publications receiving a first place
rating receive a certificate embossed
in gold, second place in silver, and
third place in bronze. Some of the
first place publications are selected to
receive a special certificate, achieving
“Medalist” rating.

Last year the Argo received a third
place rating, but this year they expect
to do much better.

LOWER SCHOOL NEWS

The Fourth grade has been studying
the Netherlands and how the Dutch
have to fight the sea. A committee has
set up an experiment in the Science
Room pots of soil and seeds. The Class
is watching to see if seeds watered
with salty water will grow.

The Sixth grade summarized their
study of Rome by making a film strip
to illustrate the outstanding events in
early Roman history. The students
drew pictures illustrating such events
as the triumphant entry of a con-
quering General and the murder of
Julius Caesar. These pasted together
to make a film strip which was shown

in a box projector made by Phillip
Shapiro and his father.
Mr. Sperduto’s seventh grade has

been studying the causes of the Rev-

olutionary War and the revolution it-
self. The class has written several
editorials and held debates showing

the viewpoints of both England and
the colonies.

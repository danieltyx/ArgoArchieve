that bit of mo: ng, I think that I

all develop a favorable atmosphere and

Theatre Club Sees
“The Corn Is Green’

The last production attended by the
Theatre Club of the Rutgers Prepara-
tory School was the current Broadway
n is Green starring the
great Ethel Barrymore. The party con-
sisted of twenty-two boys and two
masters, Mr Stearns, and Mr. Mat-
thews. This, the last play which the
group is to attend this season, was seen
on the evening of May tenth.

The play deals with the efforts of
a very determined and human woman
to help the unprivileged boys and girls
in a small Welsh mining town. To-
ward this end she determines to found
a school, since very few of the miners
can even read or write. She meets
continual opposition from the very first.
The squire checkmates her attempts to
buy a building for the school, and the
owners of the mines refuse to let their
workers study. But she perseveres,
and in the end gets her own way. Being

Honor Roll Shows
Great Increase As
Final Exams Near

The Honor Roll for the month of
May shows a sharp increase over last
month's with ten boys placing. Eight
others attained Honorable Mention.
Another source for pleasure, besides
the augmentation of names, was the
fact that the averages on the whole
were much higher

Cyril Nelson, '44, led a group of six
boys who attained an average of over
85 with a naverage of 94. He was fol-
lowed closely by David Beardslee with
92.5. Three other Seniors and a Sopho-
more also made over 85.

The general increase to eighteen of
the boys attaining an average of over
80 was a source of satisfaction. Al-
though the work this year has been
somewhat below average, this month's

SEMI-ANNUAL PARENTS’ DAY RECEPTION MADE
GREAT SUCCESS WITH BASEBALL VICTORY

The Rutgers Preparatory School held
its semi-annual Parents’ Day reception
a fortnight ago at the dormitories. It
is held in order that the parents and
teachers may become more familiar
with each other and discuss the prob-
lems of the boys. The day was some-
what windy and cloudy; however, the
sun seemed to beat through at inter-
vals, whenever the school team scored
a run. The boarding school turned
out en masse, plus the small number
of day students who could brave the
rigors of walking to the traps.

The team played baseball for the en-
tertainment of the parents. The school
was rightly victorious, 12-9. After the
game the reception and luncheon was
held in the dining room of the board-
ing school, at which time Mr. and Mrs.
Stanley Shepard, Jr., acted as host and
hostess. Mrs. Harry E. Rudy and Mrs.
Henry L. McClintock poured coffee.
The faculty members mingled with the
guests.

During Ceremony

On the morning of Thursday, June
12, the 175th Commencement of the
Rutgers Preparatory School will be
held. These exercises will be held in
the Kirkpatrick Chapel, It is com-
pulsory that every member of the Stu-
dent body be present at these exercises,
which formally close the school for the
summer months,

One of the most important aspects
of the Graduation proceedings is the
necessity that every member of the
student body come dressed in proper
attire. Mr. Shepard requests all sen-
lors come to the exercises with white
pants, a dark coat, and a white shirt.
He also asks that the underclassmen
come in a dark suit, and a white shirt.
Although dark blue suits are preferred,
any dark suit is satisfactory. If a
member of the student body does not
abide by these requests at the com-
mencement exercises, he will be greatly
embarrassed and out of place. -

Rehearsal at Nine-Thirty

At nine-thirty on the morning of
June 12, the senior class will hold a
rehearsal in Kirkpatrick Chapel, for
the commencement exercises. At ten
o'clock the entire student body will
assemble at the school building for a
final organized student meeting. Dur-
ing this period, President Joe Cramer
will give out the athletic awards for
the spring sports. Also during this
period, Mr. Shepard will give the stu.
dents final instructions about the Com-
mencement exer

At ten forty ¢, the students will
assemble by the College Avenue en-
trance to Prep school building. Here

and faculty will be formed. The un-
derclassmen will lead the Procession
and they will be lined up, according
to their respective heights, with the

PREP’S NEW SPORT

This year, for the first time, the Rutgers Preparatory School is
able to boast of a crew squad, The establishment of rowing as a
major sport may well be the start of an eventual supremacy for the
school, comparable with the championship basketball team of two
years ago. The boys have worked hard, and although their showing
in their first two races was not outstanding, still it must be realized
that they were competing against older athletes and better equipment.

The crew is of use to the school in several ways, not the least of
which is the fact that it offers a sport in which boys who do not care
for baseball may participate. condly, it gives the school an added
attraction to induce boys to come to Prep.

The boys on this first crew have worked hard. They are especially
to be commended for their interest in and enthusiasm for an activity
the future of which was doubtful at the outset and which has been con-
ducted under trying handicaps. The boathous a great distance
from the school; the transportation facilities have been erratic; and
the equiment is old and outmoded. But their efforts have shown that
crew should by all means be included in the school’s athletic curricu-
lum, since itprovides not only enjoyment for those participating, but
also excellent training in obeying orders and subordinating individual
ambition to a common objective.

It is to be hoped that someday the school will have one or more
good shells, but these will not arrive until crew is firmly established in
the interest of the boys as a whole. To reach this goal, in future years
the requisite number of students must come forward and as unselfishly
as this year’s have done put up with some inconveniences. By the
support of the school itself, the perseverance of the students, and the
help of the advisors, crew can well become as well known a function
of Prep life and as popular a sport as any other now included in the
school’s program.

Magnificently To
Lawrenceville

School Nine Fails to Stem
Attack of Opposing
Baseball Team

The Rutgers Prep baseball team lost
its first game in three starts when they
were defeated in extra innings, 5 to 4,
by a highly favored Lawrenceville nine.

The Prepsters took the lead in the
first inning when Bobby Wilson, the
Lawrenceville pitcher, was a little un-
easy and walked Harold Korshin and
Howard Woodruff, the first and third
men up. Bill Evans promptly hit a
sharp single, scoring Korshin. Again
in the first half of the third, the New
Brunswick boys hammered Wilson,
son of the Chicago Cubs’ manager,
for a run. Matty Hahn singled, stole
second, and came home to score when
Evans hit a hot liner to Dick Clark,
Lawrenceville shortstop, who allowed
it to pass into left field.

Lawrenceville came right back to
tie up the game on a walk, two errors,
gle by Al Binzen. The Prep
nine combined three errors, a hit by
Ralph Ruocco and one by Hahn to put
themselves two runs ahead in the
fourth i This ended the Prep
and they settled
down to play a brilliant defensive game.

Wilson started his team moving when
t his second home run of the sea-
son in the fifth inning. Lawrenceville
tied up the ball game as they drew two
walks and a scratch single off Hahn
who was pitching a very beautiful
game.

The score remained tied in the sev-
enth and in the first half of the cighth.
In the last half of the first extra inning,
Jack Ehnet reached second safely when
Bill Pfaff, Prep third baseman, allowed
a grounder to go through him. Then
Glass, the leadoff man, got hold of the
second pitch and walloped a line drive
to left field, driving in the winning
run.

GOLFERS LOSE CLOSE DECISIONS TO LINDEN

AND METUCHEN; DEFEAT MONTCLAIR ACADEMY

The Rutgers Prep golf team was
host to Linden on May 6th, and was
defeated by them, 7-5, on the Rutgers
University course. Dick Meyers of
Prep halved the first nine for half of
@ point, while Harvey Moynihan came
through and won his match for three
points, Bob Cramer collected a point
and a half, giving Prep a total of five
and one-half points, and Linden a total
of seven. The match was called after
twelve holes had been played,

On May 9th, the Prep golfers were
host to a powerfull Metuchen team
which subdued them 7 to 5. Meyers
halved his match for one and one-half
points. Cramer won the first nine and
halved the second for two and one-half
points. Sam Bretzfield lost his match,
while Moynihan won the first nine for
a point.

Three days later the Prepsters
traveled to Metuchen to complete the
home and home series with the Me-

tuchen High School Golf team.
Mr. Rudy's boys were overcome by
the Metuchen lads. Meyers won the
first nine and the eighteen holes for
two points. Moynihan halved the first
nine and added one half point to the
Prep score. Cramer and Bretzfield
both lost to golfers far more experi-
enced than themselves, The final score
showed Prep on the short end of a
two and one-half to nine and one-half
score.

Again

Playing by the Intercollegiate rules,
the Prep golf team subdued Montclair
Academy by a score of three and one-
half to two and one-half, on the Uni
versity course May 16. Meyers de-
feated Tomkins for one point, and both
Meyers and Bretzfield scored low ball
between them for the second point
Cramer and Moynihan were good for
one-half of a point as Cramer surpassed
his opponent for an additional point

Newark Academy MORRISTOWN BOWS

Wins Over Prep
Baseball Team, 9-8

The Rutgers Prep nine suffered their
second setback of the season when
they were overcome by Newark Acad-
emy, 9 to 8, at Newark in a very wild
and loosely played contest

he Rutgers Prep batsmen moved
into the sixth inning with an 8 to 4
lead, gained by two uprisings in the
fourth and fifth innings, but their ad-
vantage was wiped out after Bob
Clothier lost his control in the last
half of the sixth.

Clothier turned in a neat job of relief
hurling in the fourth and fifth frames,
after Dick Sexton had been knocke
out of the box, but he lost his control
and walked the first three batters to
face him in the sixth on twelve suc-
cessive pitches

Matty Hahn, who was hit on the
elbow of his pitching arm, was sent in
to hurl, but he was nicked for three
doubles by Levenson, Sears and Pe-
trucelli before the side was retired.
These five runs proved sufficient, as
the visitors were unable to score in the
last inning.

The Prepsters outhit the winners,
11 to 8, but were unable to deliver their
blows in the pinches during the early
and late stages of the slugfest.

TO HARD-HITTING
PREP BALL TEAM

A powerful Rutgers Prep nine cap-
tured its third victory in five starts by
defeating Morristown School, 10-5, at
Morristow: The game was high-
lighted by the steady pitching of Matty
Hahn and the general hitting of the
entire Prep team.

The Prepsters took the lead in the
first inning and never lost it through-
out the game. The decision inning of
the contest was the second. The New
Brunswick boys pushed over four runs
to lead 5-0. George Mederer, first man
up, drew a walk, and advanced to third
on a double by Joe Piffath. Dick
Farkas promptly singled out to left
field, advancing Piffath to third and
scoring Meder. Harold Korshin, lead-off
man, hit a line drive into center field,
for a ringing single, bringing Piffath
home to score. Jimmy Potter who had
a perfect day at Morristown by getting
three hits for three tries, added two
runs to the score by ripping out a
savage base hit into center field.

From this point on, it was easy sail-
ing for the Rutgers boys. Although
Morristown had but one less hit than
Prep, yet by the brilliant pitching of
Matty Hahn, their hits were scattered
throughout the seven innings of play,
whereas the Prepsters grouped their
hits into their scoring periods.

This was by all means the best game
the Prep team has played thus far.

prep scored three runs in the third
on two errors, a stolen base, a fly ball,
an infield out, and one hit, Ruocco’s

After the visitors had scored a single-

infield out, and a passed ball

The winning Prepsters concluded
their uprisings in the last of the fifth
with a five-run cluster. Bill ans

stealing second, going to third on an
infield out and scoring on Korshin's
blow to left. Korshin moved all the
way around to third on the throw in

The winning Prepsters, in chalking

The commencement exercises will
begin at eleven o'clock. The families
and friends of the students and faculty
are cordially invited to attend the Com-
mencement. The organ will be played
by the school’s ish master, Mr
Davis M. Simpson. The Inve

formed Church in New Brunswick:

Mr. Shepard, the headmaster of the
Rutgers Preparatory School, will be
the leader of the Commencement exer-
cises. The main speaker of the exer-
cises will be Mr. Robert Albion. Mr.
Albion is a noted and respected leader
at Princeton University at Princeton,
New Jersey.

Preceding Mr. Albion's speech the
Cum Laude Awards will be presented.
The Cum Laude Awards are given to
those members of the senior class,
who, during their stay at the Rutgers
Preparatory School, have showed their
fine scholastic ability and have done
the most to help the school as a whole.

Awards to be Made

The various other awards are then
presented by Mr. Shepard. These
awards are presented to different mem-
bers of the student body v
be given at these exercises
The John V. N. Dorr Prize, aw
to the outstanding member of the si
ior class; The Liberty Loan Prize,
awarded to the outstanding member of
the lower classes; The Headmaster’s
prize, awarded to the member of the
graduating class who has shown the
greatest scholastic improvement dur-
ing the 1940-41 year; and many others.

After Mr. Albion has given his ad-
dress to the group gathered in Kirk-
patrick Chapel, the awarding of di-
plomas will be made by Mr Shepard,
the headmaster, to the members of the
graduating class. This is the moment
of triumph for those boys who
worked hard for this diploma during
their stay at the Rutgers Preparatory
School.

friends are cordially invited to attend

Among the pupils she discovers one
with very exceptional ability, and she
tutors him privately for a couple of
years. However, she works him too
hard and gives him no real friendship
and he rebels one day, turning up in
the costume of a miner. She is hurt

given him a great deal of her time to
making him into a gentleman, and
although she would like him to return,
he can go back to his old life if he so
desires. After she has gone, he has an
affair with a bawdy little wench which
seems to calm him down, for he returns
the next day without a word and works
harder than ever. In fact, he works
with such diligence that she decides to

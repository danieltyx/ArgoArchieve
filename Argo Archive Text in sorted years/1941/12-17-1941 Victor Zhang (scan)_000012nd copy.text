November Honor
Roll Announced
by Mr. Shepard

Headmaster Praises Continued
High Standard of Work;
Mac Wells Leader

The recent announcement by Head
Master Shepard of the students attain-
ing positions on the second honor roll
of the year indicated a noticeable im-
provement in averages of individual
students and a continued high standard
for the school as a whole.

The second marking period showed
an all-round improvement scholastical-
ly in the student bo Again there
were twenty-two boys on the honor
roll: eleven seniors, three juniors, seven
sophomores, and one freshman, total-
ing nearly one-third of the school

Mac Wells Again Leads School

In announcing the honor roll, Mr.

Shepard noted the advance of the four
students at the 1 of the list. ach
of them added at least another point to
his average. Mac Wells leads the school
for the second time with an average
of 95, as high a grade as has ever been
attained at Rutgers Prep.

Not only those on the honor roll,
but the rest of the student body showed
a considerable improvement both in

Ye Dial Staff Starts
Early on Work
For Yearbook

First call has been issued by the
faculty advisers for candidates for the
school year book, Ye Dial. Two weeks
ago Mr. Matthews, who will again
serve as faculty adviser to the business
d, and Mr. Hunter, acting in the
same capacity on the editorial board,
asked to meet all boys who were
terested in either department, Since
response was not particularly heavy,
it 1s hoped that more boys will come
out. In the past, Dial has always
received an enthusiastic support from
the students, and there has generally
been at least a score of boys instru-
mental in its publication. The book
is highly regarded around the school
and is considered one of the highlights
of the year.

Senior Pictures Taken

Because there is a particularly large
amount of work to be done, the faculty
advisers have indicated their desire to
start early. Already senior pictures
have been taken and the seniors have
been asked to fill out slips giving
necessary information for senior write-
ups. Assignments for the editorial
board will be alloted soon and will be
due in mid-March. The business board
is likewise expected to start work
shortly.

ing boys are to be back at the dormi-
tories by supper time on January

Results of Argo
Music Poll Given

Tommy Dorsey Named Favorite
Dance Band; “Chattanooga

Choo-Choo” Chosen

 

 

For the second successive year,
Tommy Dorsey’s popular dance band
was voted favorite of Rutgers Prep.
Tommy emerged winner over thirty-
eight other bands which were listed by
the seventy voting students. On the

asis of three points for a first place
vote, two for a second, and one for a
third, the winner piled up 118 points
as against Glenn Miller’s 110, Although
Glenn was listed on considerably more
ballots, Tommy received a plurality of
first place votes, and these carried him
to victory. Between themselves, the
two leaders scored a majority of points.
Jimmy Dorsey tallied thirty points to
retain his third place position of last
year. Harry James scored a minor sur-
prise when he rose to fourth place with
twenty-seven points. Artie Shaw placed
fifth and Benny Goodman - sixth.
Sammy Kaye and Vaughn Monroe fol-
lowed in that order.

The strange fact about the poll was

Theatre Club Sees
Two Productions in
Excursions to Cily

s the second and third events of the
year, the Theatre Club attended “Best
Foot Forward” on November 28, and
“Watch on the Rhine” on December
12. Forty students attended the for-
mer; twelve, the latter. Twenty-eight
of those who saw “Best Foot Forward”
went by a bus chartered for the pur-
pose, while the remaining twelve went
by train.

 

 

 
    
   

Unlike many musical comedies, “Best
Foot Forward” has a plot. A prep
school admirer of Gale Joy, a screen
actress played by Rosemary Lane,

 

 

 

sends her an invitation for the senior
prom, never expecting an answer. To
his surprise she accepts after he has
arranged a date with another girl. On
this basis were built rollicking scenes
accompanied by fine acting and a num-
ber of splendid songs. As a-sample of
the wit, we might cite the remark o!
the blind date who arrives and x
“Where's Chuck Green? Let him come
and take his medicine.”

The embarassing scenes in which
Gale Joy and Helen Schlessinger, Bud’s
other date, meet face to face, and one
in which Bud tries to explain the
situation, are exceptionally funny. The
songs and dancing of the show were
definitely in keeping with the spirit of
the play. All had the feeling of juvenile
joviality and vitality. The songs were
all good, but the best three were
“Buckle Down, Winsocki,” “What Do
eu Think I Am,” and “The Three
et

 

 

 

 

 

  

“Watch On the Rhine” struck a deep
and resounding note in its subject mat-
ter. Besides being a great dramatic
play, it also serves as documental evi-
dence of the struggle over here of
anti-Hitler Germans who are trying to
help combat the exile of modern Ger-
many. Paul Lukas, who plays the male
lead, gives a wonderful performance of
a German who brings his family to
America and fights Hitlerism from the
outside. His decision that he must re-
turn alone to Germany to fight the
Nazis forms a brilliant scene of dra-
ic acting and powerful writing.

  

 

    

 

 

 

DANIEL SAIDENBURG’S LITTLE SYMPHONY
PERFORMS IN SECOND RUTGERS CONCERT

The second offering of the Rutgers
Concert Series for the season 1941-
1942, the Saidenburg Little Symphony,
Daniel Saidenburg conducting, was
presented on December 15, 1941. As
is customary, the concert was held in
the Rutgers gymnasium

Daniel Saidenburg, born in America,
is the conductor of the Saidenburg
Symphonietta, which has been touring:
the western states: Wisconsin, Michi-
gan, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and others
where it has been received with great
enthusiasm. In hundreds of concerts
Daniel idenburg has given his audi-
ences rich and beautiful selections of
music for chamber and string orches-
tra. Some of his selections are being
played in America for the first time.

In 1941 Daniel Saidenburg began in
New York his chamber orchestra
which was said to be at its debut “an
orchestral ensemble of genuine im-

   

 
 

  

   

portance.” The “Little Symphony” is
now a permanent institution in New
York. The Pro Musica of Denver has
invited Mr. Saidenburg to begin an-
other “Little Symphony” in that city.

The soloist, William Primrose, who
played at the concert, is said to be
the greatest viola player in the world
today. Primrose was born in Scotland
thirty-seven years ago and began the
study of music when he was four years
old. His father, a musician, did not
like the interest of his youngster in the
viola and set him to practicing the
violin instead. “In those days," Prim-
rose explains, “the viola was thought
of as a sort of ‘Cinderella of the strings’
—a harbor for disappointed fiddlers.”
Primrose followed his father’s advice,
and at the age of ten as a pupil of
mille Ritter played the Mendelssohn
violin concerto in Glasgow's largest

Fifty Attending Couples
Dance to Music of
“Princetonians”

On Friday evening, December 5,
the Rutgers Preparatory School held
its annual Fall dance at the Prep
School gymnasium. The dance had one
of the largest attendances of any that
has ever been held at the Prep School.
There were approxi ly sixty-fiv
couples in attendance at the dane:
They included the students of the
school, the faculty, and the lovely
ladies who came with them, A number
of special friends of the Prep students
also came to the dance

This dance was truly a masterpiece
of work by the dance committee and
the faculty advisor, Mr, Benjamin A.
Matthews. The capable committee con-
sisted of nine boys: Ray Ries, Fred
Howell, Bob Schweitzer, Mac Wells,
George Zeigler. James Lategano,
George Mederer, Bill Pfaff, and Ted
Minde, David Beardslee, the treasurer
of the school, attended to all money
matters concerning the dance. The
gym was decorated with furniture from
the Prep School dormitories. Different
college and high school pennants
adorned the walls of the gymnasium,
and maroon and white drapes hung
over the dance floor. The setting of
the dance was cheerful and colorful.

= Girls Stay in Alpha House

The dance was a semi-formal affair,
the girls coming in formal dress and
most of the boys wearing tuxedos. The
girls who were invited to the dance
by the boarding students arrived Fri-
day afternoon after luncheon. These
girls ate dinner with their escorts in
the Prep School dining room that even-
ing. Six of the girls stayed overnight
in the Alpha house which had been
made ready for their use. They made
their departure from_ the boarding
school after breakfast Saturday.

The chaperones for the dance were:
Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Shepard Jr., Mr.
and Mrs. Harry E. Rudy, Mr. and
Mrs. Benjamin A. Matthews, Mrs,
George C. Andrews, Mr. Andreas Z
Holley, and Mr. Guy F. Blake. x
he orchestra which supplied the fine
music for the dance was the Prince-
tonians. This is the same aggregation
that played at both Prep dances last
year. The orchestra began pla ing at
nine o'clock and continued to play un-
til one o'clock when the strains of

WAR COMES TO AMERICA

Last Sunday afternoon there were millions of people in the United
States who were resting peacefully at home after a hard week of
work. They were sitting back in their easy chairs quietly listening
to a concert, relaxing from the cares of the world. Suddenly a news-
caster broke in to give a strange report that Hawaii had been attacked,
the Phillipines had been raided. Eagerly they listened for further
details; frantically they turned their dials to other stations unable
to believe the first report true. Everywhere they heard the same tragic
broadcasts. Finally they realized that the grim reality of war had
come to America. The reports continued into the evening: the Japan-
ese had made a treacherous attack on American, British and Dutch
possessions in the Pacific.
There was only one answer to this deliberate attack. The next
day President Roosevelt asked Congress for a declaration of war.
Congress responded quickly, unanimously. Even Senator Wheeler,
foremost of the isolationists, asserted that now was the time to give
the Japanese hell. Within 48 hours of this first indication of war, there
were ugly rumors of attacking forces on both the Atlantic and Pacific
coasts. San Francisco had been blacked out; New York had been
warned of an air raid; Boston had heard rumors of an attacking force
on the New England coast; patriotic young Americans had swelled
enlistments in the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, and Marines tremend-
ously; Japanese had been beaten up by over-enthusiastic Americans ;
one lady in San Francisco was shot perhaps fatally by an overanxious
Home Guardsman when she failed to stop her car during a blackout;
commercial planes were grounded. The American people realized that
the blitzkrieg with its characteristic swiftness had come.
A bit panicky at first the American populace settled down to
get its first real taste of warfare.

YE DIAL

Since the announcement that work on YE DIAL, the school
yearbook, would commence soon, there has been a surprising dearth
of candidates for position on the publication. This is a bit of a pity,
because it is not only a thing of import to the school but also one of
great interest to the individual. .

YE DIAL is essentially a student institution. It is written for
the school, of the school, and by the school. It comprises a written
record of a school year which is of interest to everyone attending,
especially to the members of the senior class, for whom it will be
a memento of Prep days, a memento long cherished. Extra-curricular
activities are described, and photographs of participants in each group
are included. If a boy was on the varsity football squad, he can again
see through the pages of YE DIAL those who were his fellow-players.

Perhaps its greatest benefit, however, is to the one who helps
write it. Naturally, it is good experience, for the boy who has done
more writing will be that far ahead of the one who has not. Also,
there is an indescribable thrill to be gained from seeing one’s own
work in print, and this glow of satisfaction is well worth the few hours
work spent in writing and composition. The nearest comparison to
this we can think of is the joy of making a home run with all bases

loaded, and even this is less satisfactory, because, whereas a home
run is soon over and forgotten, a piece of printing lives on for many
years. Therefore, YE DIAL is an institution which should be liberally
supported, both for personal motives and for the sake of the school.

It is hoped that the recent appoint-

cause they fold up so easily.

THE BOOKWORM .-.--

 

THE TIMELESS LAND
by Eleanar Dark

Here is the accurate and timely story
of the beginnings of one of the main
outposts of the British Empire, told
with vigour and verve by a lady who
should know of such things, since she
is an Australian herself. While a bit
longer than the average novel, it sus-
tains the reader's interest all the way
through, and is well worth the reading.

Australia received its first permanent

settlement in 1788 when there arrived a
shipload of convict-settlers under the
governorship of Arthur Phillip. The
book deals with their difficulties in
forming a settlement, the hardships
suffered, and the degradation of the
savages who lived there through con-
th the white man.
As fitting in such a vast topic as
this covers, it is shown from a great
many viewpoints, and traces the lives
of a great many people. Perhaps the
most important of thes Governor
Phillip himself. By the time he took
over the command he was getting past
his prime, but he continued in his posi-
tion until ill health completely forced
him to give up his office and to retire.
But until that time he was continually
exploring and organ
nd choosing, and meting out re-
wards and punishments in a very fair,
impartial manner. The country was.
fortunate to have so good a man at
its head during those first few years,
for without his assistance the colony
would have surely perished.

The convicts, naturally, were any-
thing but happy at being shipped off
to a cold and hostile land and there
being required to construct their own
gaols. All tried to effect escapes, and
some few actually succeeded. Among
these was a red-head by the name of
Prentice, who left his wife and child
to sneak off to. freedom. After labori-
ously constructing over a long time a
cache of necessities, he escaped one
night, and took up a life of freedom, if
not of comfort, in the woods. He even

  

     

 
 

  

  

    

 

 

married an Indian wife and founded a
farm with the aid of some cattle which
he found roaming the forest. Here he
lived his life, at first sullenly, and then
more peaceabl: he began to taste
the pleasures of honesty and the re-
wards of toil, He finally reformed to
such an extent that he laid down his
life for the rest of his family when
they were caught by a flood.

The Indians were perplexed by the
presence of the men who came in big
ships. The white man did not harm
them, nor did they make war on their
tribe, but there was something about
them which inspired fear. They gave
presents and wore great smil but did
they not on occasion steal some of the
warriors and take them to the magic
settlement? And after taking them, they
did not kill them, as one would obvi-
ously expect, but treated them kindly.
It was all very hard to comprehend.
But there was little conflict between
the two groups, because neither antag-
onized the other. The Indian was
peaceful but wary, the white man tol-
erant but uninterested.

The fatherland did not send enough
supplies to the struggling colony, and
for a long time the group almost failed
from starvation. The men did not know
how to obtain food by hunting, nor
were they sufficiently proficient at
farming to meet their needs. A supply
ship was wrecked on the journey from

gland, and this created yet more
difficulty. However, in spite of hard-
ships of this sort, in spite of difficulties
with the convicts, and in spite of the
terrible loneliness which assailed every-
one, the settlement held on tenaciously,
and by the end of the book had
achieved a firm foothold on the land.

It is a momentous tale, expressing
well the vastness of the country and
the diminutiveness of the puny attempt
to settle it. It is packed with life and
adventure, cach one of the characters
having a definite personality which
makes him live. Miss Dark tells her
story well, and gi it reality.

End Disappointing Seasons; Winter Sports

 

Prep Varsity and
J-V teams have
unfruitful year

Twenty-nine Players from both
Teams Awarded Letters
at Fall Dance

The Rutgers Prep gridiron squads
have completed their 1941 season with
none too successful a showing. The
varsity dropped their opener to Mor-
ristown School and then bowed to Car-
teret Academy. Prep bowled over New-
man and lost a heartbreaker to George
School of Pennsylvania the following
week. The Maroon and White con-
cluded their season by being trampled
by both Montclair and Newark.

The letters and certificates for both
squads were given out at the December
5 football dance, Lettermen for the
varsity were: co-Captains Bob Havens
and Danny Williams, Chuck Meissner,
Bill Vogelsang, Brud Bispham, Dick
Sexton, Bob Nafey, Phil Wight, George
Mederer, Al Evans, Ed Gustafson,
Johnny Linder, Bill Wurzberger, Gor-
don Dunham, Bob Deming, Dominick
Lategano, and Wilbur Houts.

Dick Sexton, Bill, Wurzberger,
George Mederer, and Dominick Late-
gano are the only varsity regulars that
will be left by the 1942 graduation to
Coach Walter Petke and Assistant
Coach Holley.

The J. V. team lost its opener to
Peddie School, and then held Pingry
to a scoreless deadlock. However,
when the game was replayed a week
later, the Prep lightweights lost a bit-
terly fought contest 13 to 6.

The lettermen are: Captain Thomas
Bishop, Don Conhagen, Linwood Lee,
Andrew Cook, Fred Klein, Howard
Woodruff, Edward Burroughs, Leon-
ard Waterman, George Ziegler, Bill
Pfaff, Bruce Odell, and Bob Beaudette.
This year the coaching duties of the
. V.’s were taken over by Mr. Gariss,
who replaced Mr. McClintock.

Another season of football disap-
pointments has come to an end. Al-
though the Prep team showed little
of the '38 stuff, yet we did win a game
and everyone did profit by the season's
workout. Letters and certificates were
awarded to the members of the Varsity
znd Junior Varsity teams at the De-
cember 5th dance held in their honor.
We might add that the dance was one
of the most successful dances this
school has ever had.

**

Our basketball squads are beginning
to take shape. Although the actual
season does not get under way until
after the Christmas vacation, much of
the work must be done before we leave.
As a member of the squad, I feel that
we should have a good season. Every-
one on the squad is doing his best.
How about you doing your part in sup-
porting the team? Editor-in-chief Bob
Beaudette is planning to have a pep
rally before our first game. He be-
lieves that it might give the team the
extra something which has been lack-
ing on the squads of the past two years.

** *

The past school dance was but a
sample of the success we can have in
this school if the student body would
back all events 100%.

** *

It is indeed unfortunate that there
is an insufficient amount of material
to have a swimming team this winter,
for there are certain individuals in
school who are excellent swimmers,
Tough luck, Leonard! Coach Holley
has turned out very successful teams
in the past few years, and it is too bad
that practically his entire squad was
lost last graduation.

The Rutgers Prep Varsity eleven
closed its 1941 season by being van-
quished by a far superior, and unde-
feated Newark Academy team at New-
ark, 37 to 0. .

Mike Castrilli, high scoring fullback
who tallied 25 points, sparked the
Academy offense. The ex county
gridmen ripped their way through the
Prep defense for four touchdowns in
the first half, and gathered six-pointers
in each of the last two quarters, to give
the Prepsters their fourth defeat of
the season. : .

Shortly after the opening kick-off,
Newark Academy ploughed through
the weak Rutgers Prep defense for 48
yards and a score in nine successive
running plays. Mike Castrilli plunged
over from the four yard line and booted
the extra point. In the closing minutes
of this same period, the Newark full-
back traveled 13 yards for his second
touchdown on a wide end-run.

Midway through the second quarter,
Castrilli smashed over from the five
yard marker, after a sustained drive
of forty yards. With but a few seconds
left in the half, Grymes passed to Kist-
ler in the end-zone for the fourth tally,
after Dickinson had ripped off tackle
for 20 yards to set up the pass play.

28 Candidates
Report for Ist
Basketball Drill

Answering Coach Petke’s call for
basketball material, some twenty-eight
candidates reported at the Prep gym
on Monday, November 24 to commence
work-outs. After a week of prelim-
inary drill, Mr. Petke has announced
that fifteen boys have achieved varsity
status while the remaining | thirteen
have been delegated to the Junior Vars-
ity under Mr. Blake.

Although Mr. Petke has only three
veterans, George Mederer, Thomas
Bishop and’ Dick Farkas, returning
from last year’s squad, plus Phil Rueg-
ger, who has been promoted from the
Jay-Vees, there is considerable new
talent on the team. Other members
are Bill Wurzberger, Bill Vogelsang,
Don Gustafson, Bob Schweitzer, Dan
Williams, John Muench, John Linder,
Harry Cohen, Will Houts, Bob Dem-
ing, and Al Evans. The varsity will
hold drills for three weeks before the
Christmas holidays, and then will prac-
tice a week after, before embarking
on a tough thirteen-game schedule. It
is sincerely hoped that the basketball
team will achieve a much better record
than it did last year. If the same spirit
prevails here as did on the football
team, certainly it will.

Ted Minde, Fred Klein, and Gordon
Spencer are returning to Mr. Blake’s
Junior Varsity, which has scored sev-
eral notable victories in the past two
years. Horace Dinwiddie, Dominic
Lategano, James Lategano, Howard
Woodruff, Gordon Manley, _ Bob
Clothier, Bob Kenlan, Bruce Odell,
Max Raab, and Phil Wight compose
the rest of the squad. As has been
the custom for the past few years, the
Jay-Vees will play most of their games,
both home and away, as preliminaries
to the varsity contests, thus forming
double-headers.

 

 

  

   

 

Mr. Roy has been bitten by the war
bug. Defense is his by-word. He has
recently organized a rifle team with a
half-dozen hopefuls. The newly orga-
nized team is using the Rutgers rifle
range and being bothered by the
recreational swimmers who feel it their
duty to inspect the rifle team’s daily
progress. Mr. Roy informs me that
Fred Howell, gunning enthusiast,
showed unusual skill in the first few

TARGET PRACTICE
HELD IN RUTGERS
GYM BY PREP BOYS

Recently a group of boys, under the
leadership of Fred Howell, expressed
interest in target shooting. Mr. Shep-
ard, eager to see this sport revived,
promptly made arrangements with the
Military Department of the University
for the use of the indoor rifle range.

At the present time, owing to in-
reased military activity at the Uni-
versity, only a limited use of the range
was obtainable. Also each boy must
furnish his own rifle as well as am-
munition. Since boys really interested
in shooting would normally do this
anyway, this requisite can in no wise
be construed as being severe.

Whereas there has been mention of a
team, for the present at least, owing to
the small allotment of time, any very
ambitious program in that regard will
be necessarily out of the question. As
is the case with any sport, daily prac-
tice is one of the many factors essential
to the development of a team. It is
possible that at some future date more
shooting hours may be allotted to the
Prep and thus outside competition be
made more likely.

Some of the riflemen putting in an
appearance so far are: Frank Clark.
Marcus Wright, Fred Lambert, Bill
Van Der Meulen, Andy Cook, Bob
Nafey, Fred Howell, and Edwin Nel-
son. Mr. Roy is in charge of the group.

Already the boys are finding that
even in a fifty foot range straight
shooting taxes to the utmost the eye-
sight and nerves, and that after a two
hour session they are ready to call it
quits.

DANCE BAND
(Continued from Page 1)
that the tastes of this year's Prep stu-
dents seemed to be about the same as
last year's. The results of the poll also
corresponded almost exactly to the
results of nation-wide survey

“Chattanooga Choo-Choo,” which
was at the height of its popularity when
the balloting was taken, was voted as
favorite popular song. It piled up forty-

points to lead “I Don’t Want to
Set the World on Fire” which polled
twenty points. “You and I” was third
and “Elmer's Tune” fourth. “Concerto
for Two" and “Tonight We Love” fol-
lowed in fifth and sixth places respec-
tively.

Other such former favorites as “Al-
exander's me Band,” “Little
Brown Jug,” “The Blue Danube
Waltz”, and “Marie” ranked high on
the list.

Prep, playing without the services of
two of its outstanding stars, Tommy
Bishop and George Ziegler, got off to
a good start in the first quarter when
Don Conhagen passed twenty yards to
Bill Pfaff in the end zone. Conhagen’s
attempted rush for the extra point just
fell short. . ;

In the second quarter the Elizabeth
boys began to move. Led by Nugey and
Cuneo they drove to the one-yard line
where Cuneo plunged over for six
points. An attempted place kick failed
to garner the extra point.

Through the third period the two
clubs battled fiercely, but a beautiful
thirty yard pass from Cuneo to Brader
gave Pingry a surprise touchdown. The
Blue converted on a drop kick. Prep
recovered a fumble deep in Pingry ter-
ritory in the final period, but time ran
out before the Maroon was able to
capitalize on the break.

Don Conhagen’s running and pass-
ing sparked the Prep offensive, while
Okerson and Lategano gave commend-
able performances in the line.

VARSITY CHOOSES
HAVENS, WILLIAMS;
J-V’s NAME BISHOP

In the elections of captains to the
Varsity and Jay-Vece football squads,
which took place soon after the season
ended, the varsity squad chose to elect
co-captains, choosing in a very close
ballot Dan Williams and Bob Havens,
both seniors. The Jay-Vees chose their
injured halfback, Tom Bishop.

Though this is only his first year
at Prep, Danny Williams has become
well liked by the boys and teachers
alike. Dan's shy manner when he is
off the field changes to aggressiveness
when he takes to the gridiron. In spite
of his size Dan held up his position
at quarterb: nobly, always seeming
to know the right play to call. Danny
is now out for basketball.

Bob Havens has also achieved his
share of popularity in his first year at

rep. ob's stalwart work at his
guard position was always a source of
i ation to his team-mates.

Tom Bishop is a member of THE
ARGO staff and the basketball team
as well as an outstanding football
player. On the gridiron Tom sparked
the Jay-Vee eleven through most of
the season. In the Jay-Vee's scoreless
tie with Pingry, however, his elbow
was injured and he was unable to com-
plete the schedule. .

It is felt that excellent juderment was
shown in the selection of the captains
from among the large group of Prep
students who all worked faithfully to
chalk up a successful season for the

school.

Gloria Callen,

Attends Dance

Smashes Two World’s Records
at Rutgers Gymnasium
on Same Night

 

Miss Gloria Callen, outstanding
woman swimmer in the world, reigned
as queen of the Rutgers Prep dance
last Friday, and hardly a more popu-
lar queen could have been chosen. Miss
Callen, who thrilled capacity crowds
for two successive nights at the Rut-
gers University Water Carnival, came
to the dance directly after her sensa-
tional Friday night show in which she
smashed two world records formerly
held by Eleanor Holm.

Miss Callen arrived in New Bruns-
wick on Thursday afternoon, accom-
panied by her father and mother. She
made a tour of the Rutgers campus and
was photographed in the various de-
partments of the college, posing with
students. In her appearances at the
Water Carnival on Thursday and Fri-
day nights, she gave a demonstration
of her swimming style which has car-
ried her to fame. She also showed her
famous speed turns. On Friday night
she received the applause of the spec-
tators for her magnificent record-
breaking performances.

At the dance Friday night Miss Cal-
len was escorted by Bill Wurzberger.
Bill and Mr. Shepard alike will not

  

   

 

  

 

 

  

hesitate to testify that she is a fine
dancer. Miss Callen was espec ly pop-
ular when the pictures were being

taken, Numerous Prep fellows grouped
around her so that they might be in

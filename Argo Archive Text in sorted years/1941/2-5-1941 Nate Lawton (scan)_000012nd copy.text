Dr. W. H. Demarest
Tells of Prep In

Its Earlier Year
Former Master and Rutgers

President Sketches Long
School History

 

One of the most well-known of the
graduates of the Rutgers Preparatory
School is Dr. William H. S. Demarest
Dr. Demarest has served as president
of Rutgers University and of the New
Brunswick Theological Seminary and
is recognized as a leading histonan
with several books to his credit

Mr. Demarest has been affiliated with
Rutgers Prep as both a teacher and a
student. He entered the school in 1874
and was graduated in 1879 Among
his teachers were two men later to be
come very famous, one Alexander Jolin-
ston later professor at Princeton Uni
versity, the other Foster M. Voorhees,
came governor of New Jersey.
He passed the next four years in Rut-
gers Univers and immediately after
graduation joined the teaching staff of
the school as master of Latin, history
and also some science, a Herculean
task which the teachers of that time
were accustomed to.

ree Years as Master

Dr, Demarest was associated with
the school in the capacity of master
for three years. During this time the
dormitories, headmaster’s residence, and
playing fields were situated on Hamil-
ton Street, almost a mile from the
school. The dormitories even at that
time were called the “trap.” Dr, Dema-
rest suggests that this was the natural
derivation for the title given the stu-
dents, “rats.” The student body at this
time was about the same size as it is
now; however, it is interesting to know
that then there were a large number
of Japanese students in both the college
and preparatory school. Rutgers Prep
was the first secondary school in the
country to have Japanese students, and
Demarest particularly recalls one
named Matsugata, whose father
ne Minister of Japan. At
one time, a matter of fact, there
were even girls at Rutgers Prep; how-

 

 

   

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ever, this practice did not last long.
Perhaps the headmaster thought that
they were too distracting

Id Curriculum and Drills

The curriculum of the school while
Dr. Demarest was here was about the
same as it is now. Special attention
was paid to spelling bees and debating,
such as speaking on certain topics be-
fore the class. Now there is a crying
need for good spellers and there has
been also some mention made of form-
ing a debating society. Dr, Demarest
also explained that at that time there
was no elementary school, but the
younger boys had a room of their own
on the second floor. The third floor
was given over to a gymnasium. Dr
Demarest recalls the time when he
and his chums would parade there with
wooden guns in military fashion. It
is even rumored that those guns are
still there. While Dr. Demarest was
at Rutgers Prep, there were five
classes instead of the four there are
today. These were called First Class,
Second Class, etc. not Senior, Junior.
etc., their common appellation today

As for the extra-curricular activities |

 

 

there were few. The only two sports
were football and baseball. Dr. Dema-
rest remembers being permitted to play
on the school baseball team at first
base. If this were possible today, we

Theatre Club To
See “Twelfth Night”
With Hayes, Evans

The Theatre Club of the Rutgers
Preparatory School will go to New
ork to sce a stage hit. The play which
they will see on February 22 is the
current Shakespearean success,
elfth Night.” Two of the world’s
most. renowned stage players, Helen
Hayes and Maurice Evans, are starred
inthe play. Miss Hayes plays the
part of Vi falas while Evans plays the
part of Malvolio. The play 1s one of
the most successful of the current group
of plays in New York City. Most of
the people, who have seen this comedy,
have enjoyed it immensely,
Synopsis of Play

girl who disguises herself as a young
man so as to gain entrance to a Duke's
court. The Duke is in love with Oliv
a rich countess, whom he has never
seen, bee «© ever since her brother
had died ae had covered her face with

School Basketball Game
And Dinner March 8

Several weeks ago we, the under-
signed, sent letters to the members of
the last five graduating classes to di
cover what their attitude would be to-
ward an Alumni Association at Rut
gers Prep. We are happy to announce
a very favorable response on the part
of the Alumni

Our object in sending out these let
ters was to create, if possible, a work-
ing Alumni Association that would take
an active part in the affairs of the
Prep School. Now we are ready to
form definite plans

The first activity sponsored by the
Association, will be a basketball game
between members of the Prep school’s
last three State Championship teams
and the present Varsity. The game
has been set tentatively for March 8th.
The proceeds of the game will go into
an athletic fund for the school.

Alumni Dinner Planned

An Alumni dinner has been planned
for later in March. The dinner is go-
ing to be held at the boarding school
Members of the faculty and many
alumni will be present, and definite ob-
jectives of the Association will be dis-
cussed. At present a constitution is
being drawn up. It will be presented
to the Alumni at the dinner for their
approval. Announcements of the date
of our first meeting will be sent out

 

 

shortly
We, who have laid the foundation of
this organization, have many other

plans in mind that will be of interest
to both undergraduates and alumni
alike, but these cannot be revealed until
after the first meeting

There has been a definite lack of in
terest in the school on the part of the
alumni. Through an Alumni Associa-
tion we hope to bring about a complete

Peruvian Student Describes Life In Homeland
During Course Of Interview With “Argo” Reporter

According to Peruvian Richard
Thorne, life in Peru is not much dif-
ferent from ours. In Peru the people
do not speak Castilian but a provincial
dialect. Dick hails from Lima, the
capital. The word Lima is a corrup-
tion of Rimac, that also being the name
of the river which runs through the
city

Dick says that the Church plays an
important part in the life of every
Peruvian. Since the days of the Vice-
royalty and the Royal Audience, the
Church has been shorn of all political

power, but she still retains spiritual
sway.
During the rainy season it rains

about eight times a day, in fact they
reckon time by these showers

For amusement the people walk in
the Prado, which corresponds to our
Central Park. Most of the government
buildings and the Cathedral face it.
Royal Palms line the walks, and the
gardens are filled with luxuriant flow-

Jers of every description. Pizarro
| planned the park and laid the corner-
stone of the Cathedral; also his re-
mains are buried there. Most of the
sports played by us are enjoyed by

Peruvians; some are soccer, lacrosse,
and baseball. In the evening the
Peruvian goes to the Opera or the

National Theatre, and if he feels lucky
he may go to the Casino, or to play
Jai_Alai.

with a 92 average. Nelson is followed
by the leader of the Junior class, David

average. The Sophomore class is
headed by Edward Burroughs with an
average of 83.

Commenting upon the
Shepard remarked “With world con
ditions being as they are, it is doubt
ful whether many of you after leaving
Rutgers Prep will be able to carry
on with your education. When I was
a young man and went to college,
there were many students who left
school because of the war and with
the expectation of returning as soon
as it was over. For various reasons
the majority of these men were not
fortunate enough to return. With this
in mind, it is to your great advantage
to put your heart and soul into your
work and acquire as much knowledge
as you can while you have the op-
portunity to do so. An education is
something that cannot be taken away
from you. Your worldly goods may
be taken but never your knowledge

Schooldays not “Marking Time”

“The student who acquires good
marks not only distinguishes himself
but gives much encouragement to his
Parents and to the faculty. For many
of us, school is just a matter of mark-
ing time. This 1s the wrong attitude to
take, for although we take some sub-
jects for which we see no practical
need, they are all beneficial in making
us think properly

‘There are many who would
welcome the opportunity of going to

privilege of attending to fine school,
we should try to do our level best

DICTATORSHIP OR DEMOCRACY

Montesquicu, a French jurist and scholar, once said that when all
powers of a nation are united under one control, despotism is the out-
come; when they are divided among king, parliament, and courts, as
he believed the case to be in England, one checks and balances the
other, and the result is freedom, The United States has much the same
type of government as England, with its power divided between the
President and the members of Congress.

It is not difficult to imagine how this country would be run if con-
trolled by a single person or dictator. ‘There are never two sides to
any question in a dictatorship. There is never any difference of
opinion in a dictatorship. The dictator is always doing the right thing.
for his subjects, even though they may think and believe differently.
Anyway, in a dictatorship people are not supposed to believe anything
or think anything—the dictator usually does all this without much
help from his people. A dictator is usually so feared by his people
that he can use them in any way and for any purpose that he sees tit.
Dictatorships have been attempted from time to time and always with
the same results. Tyrannic rule over a suppressed, down-trodden, and
degenerate people is always the inevitable result.

In a democracy we have two sides to every question and a dif-
ference of opinion in all activity. It is only a consolidation of these
two opposing forces that can make a nation truly great and inde-
pendent. A homogeneous combination of ideas and ideals in a free
nation is the seed that will eventually bring forth a most fruitful and
healthy tree of civilization. In a nation that is to survive, all activity
must be directed by the general will of the people. A nation cannot and
will not survive unless that nation is controlled by a balance of power
which is subject to the general rule of the people. It can therefore be
understood that the only nations that can survive are those nations
that adopt a democratic form of government.

We in America have a very fine form of democratic government.
It is therefore up to us and to us alone to keep burning that light of
liberty which our forefathers lit. D. D.

A RETROSPECT

It is often worthwhile to review the events of the past year or so.
and end of term is a good time to do this. While life in school has
gone on in the same way that it always does, major events have been
taking place in the world at large. Although most of us have little
noticed it, the year 1940 will go down in history as among the most
troubled of a century. But nothing very startling has occured in our
own lives. We go to the movies, play games, and do schoolwork in
exactly the same way that we always have. There have been no air
raids to terrorize the community, we have lost no friends in the
trenches, and, as yet, the conscription has affected none of us directly.

But there is an entirely different situation in Europe. Boys sixteen
and seventeen have left school to join in the battle, and even those who
are too young are engaged in one kind or another of helpful work. All
available manpower is being used for warlike purposes, and little time
is left for the more peaceful pleasures and occupations of life. The
populace lives in a perpetual state of terror, and the wail of the air raid
siren can be heard many times daily. While our large cities, such as
New York, Chicago or Boston, twinkle merrily with the brilliance of
neon signs, and the noise of revelers, the foreign metropolis of today
lies shrouded in darkness from the fall of evening, no light whatsoever

TRELAWNEY
by Margaret Armstrong
Macmillan, New York. 1940
The life of Edward Trelawney —

sailor, deserter, robber and adventurer
—was an exceedingly thrilling one, and
Miss Armstrong, who is also the au-
thor of another best selling biography
called Fanny Kemble, portrays it well.
By the staggering number of refer-
ences in the text and the source
books given in the bibliography, it is
quite evident that every fact has been
checked and rechecked, making it not
only a good story but also an accurate
ane well-authenticated story of a man’s
ife.

The family of Trelawney has long
been important among the people on
the west coast of England, and they
have always been noted for a tendency
to act fist and think afterwards. But
they have also been noted for mean-
ness and miserliness, and Edward's
father was no exception to this rule.
He was so unfeeling that when a child
accidentally fell on one of his many
bottles of wine and broke it, even al-
though the child had been quite serious-
ly hurt, the elder Trelawney immedi-
ately cuffed it severely for wasting the
wine. Such an atmosphere is not con-
ducive to patience, tolerance, and a

happy childheod, and Edward Tre-
lawney, whe was livelier than his
brothers, was in continual trouble. This
produced in him both a hatred for his
father and a general bitterness against
the world waich remained with him
for many years.

As he grew older he grew conse-
quent!y more precocious, and at last
his father secured him a berth as a
midshipman, with the idea that if he
did not get drowned or killed, a hap-
pening which was very frequent, the
navy wouuld at least knock some of the
impudence out of him. While life
aboard his ship was both rigorous and
dangerous, he did not mind it very
much, because for the first time in
his life, he made some friends among
his fellow-sufferers. He even became
a good boy, and his discharge was
highly satisfactory, but even then his
father would not let him return home,
but sent him to a school of seaman-
ship, where he immediately got in a
fight and shot his opponent. He was
not seriously injured, but it was be-
lieved best for all concerned that he
should leave, and so he immediately
put to sea again. But this trip was
not so happy as the previous one, be-
cause a mate took a dislike to the boy
and proceded to make life a torture for

him, until an act of heroism on Tre-
lawney’s part brought him to the cap-
tain’s attention, after which the mate
abruptly ceased. But if he was unable
ty annoy young Edward, he used the
next best means—annoying a weak hoy
named Walter to whom Edward had
taken a liking. Things became so un
bearable that the pair deserted, al
though not until Trelawney | had
thrashed the offending mate to within
an inch of his life

Walter then joined the army, and
Trelawney joined up with a bkrench-
yter as ate
against the British. This mantwac unt
of the three who were to change his
life the most. De Ruyter changed him
from an. inexperienced young boy to
a man of action, an African girl named
Zela was to arouse his emotions. and
the poet Shelley was destined to open
his soul. After a few diminutive bat-
tles he sailed to Madacasyar where
he helped to subdue the savage natives
who had become a bit too obstreperous
While there he saved a young girl
named Zela from death, and later fell
in love with her. F 1 most im
portant of his many loves, Zela re-
mained dear to him for the rest of his
life, and when she died, a great blank.
ness enveloped him which he never
entirely lost.

After Zela’s tragic death (she was
poisoned by a jealous hussy who had
wished to win Trelawney) he returned
to England where he was received al-
most gladly by his family, and here
he marricd for a second time, but in-
mediately divorced the lady after he
found that she already had a lover. It
was about tins time that he met Shelley
and Byron, about a year before the
former's trazic death by drowning, and
it was they who roused the artist in
him and intluenced him perhaps more
tha oue else. This was especially
true of Shelley. Byron he was in awe
of and distked in many ways. His
days with these people in Italy were
among the happiest of his life.

His last great adventure was fighting
with one of the bandit leaders during
the war in Greece, but this episode,
which he had intended to be so glorious
and victorious, fizzled out and failed
miserably, and Edward Trelawnev,
humiliated by the event, went back to
England and took a cottage in a small
village, where he spent the rest of his
life peacefully engaged in gardening.

Passionate in both friendship, love,
and love of freedom, Edward Trelaw-
ney lived a life of almost incredible
adventures, And his biographer brings
out all its colors in a book that will
be increasingly popular as fine, Fors

/NEWARK ACADEMY’S LATE RALLY NIPS

PREP IN WILD SCORING GAME, 52-16

Rutgers Prep's court forces carried
more scoring punch than was suspected
of a decidedly underdog combination,
but the vital offensive drive slackened
in the crucial moments of the last quar
ter and the visitors from the Banks
of the Raritan went down to a 52 to
46 defeat at the hands of the unde
feated and highly-favored Newark
Academy passers at Newark

Figured as a set-up on the basis
of comparative records, Coach Walt
Petke's Maroon and White cagers re-
peatedly wiped out deficits that ranged
from one to nine points during a strug-
gle that saw the score tied five times
and the lead change hands on a dozen
occasions, but the invading forces weak-
ened midway in the last quarter after
Bill Howell's foul toss had evened the
count at 42- all

From this point on, the Newarkers,
unbeaten in { ve contests this season,
moved ahead to clinch the decision.
Four field goals by Gleason and an
other by Gulla netted the Newarkers
10 successive points before Moynihan
and Howell countered with field goals
which narrowed the gap to six points

Jay-Vees Top Newark
On Potter’s Late Goal

The Prep Jay-Vee five won its sec-
ond game out of three starts by de-
feating the Newark Academy Jay-Vees
24 to 22 at Newark on January 21. Prep
went right into a 9 to 1 lead in the
opening period when John Hacke
scored five points and Bill Evans and
Walt Spratiord, two points cach. _

However, in the next two periods,
Newark came back and paced by Har
Schottland, the high scorer with 12
points, went into the lead 19 to 18 at
the end of the third quarter. Through-
out the last quarter, Newark managed
to keep the score evened up. However,
in the closing seconds of the game, a

to 22 deadlock was broken, and
Prep went ahead to win 24 to 22 when
Dick Farkas retrieved a loose ball in
a scramble and passed the length of

was deadlocked twice, the Maroon and
White stormed the homesters defense
with a blistering flurry of field goals
to get away to a 17 to 14 lead, but the
victors rallied their forces to move
in the van, 31 to 28, at the intermission

Rutgers Prep roared back to take a
41 to 39 lead at the three-quarter mark,
but after coming from the rear to even
the count at 42 all midway in the
concluding quarter, they wilted in the
face of Newark’s blistering late assault

Moynihan, Howell and Matty Hahn
starred in defeat, the second in as many
starts for Rutgers Prep, while Cart-
mill, with 17 points, and Gleason, who
tabbed 13 points, stood out for the
victors.

Powerful Pingry
Courtmen Topple
Prepsters, 51-31

The Rutgers Prep basketball team
opened its season against Pingry School
and was defeated 51 to 31 on the George
Street court in a game featured by the
brilliant offensive playing of a fast
Pingry quintet

The first period was a close battle,
with both teams feeling one another
out. Harvey Moynihan scored the first
basket of the game to put Prep in the
lead. Then Bob Hanlon and Joe Long
each scored to put Pingry ahead 4 to
2. The boys from Elizabeth were quick
to take advantage of the Prepster’s
inexperience and soon piled up a sub-
stantial lead which the home boys
could not overcome for the rest of the
game. At the end of the first quarter
Pingry led 11 to 8 In the second
period Matty Hahn, Dick Meyers, and
Harvey Moynihan each scored one bas-
ket, while Hanlon, Hagedorn, and Long
tallied twelve points between them to
make the score at the half, Pingry 23,
Prep 14.

The third quarter really turned the
tide when Pingry led by Hanlon and
Long scored 21 points to Prep's 7
Moy in made 6 out of the seven
points with Dick Meyers adding the
other on a foul shot. In the last period,
Prep started to rally, but in vain, scor-
ing 10 points to Pingr: The out
standing feature of the game was the
aggressiveness of Moynihan of Prep
with 18 points and of Hanlon and Long
with 22 and 14 points respectively

Prep Natators
Lose To George
School, 35-29

Miller, Waterman, Piffath
Relay Team Winners
In Heated Meet

In a meet between two well-matched
aggregations, Rutgers Prep's swimming
team lost to the powerful George School
natators, 35 to 29. The Rutgers Uni-
versity Pool was the scene of the
meet, held January 18.

Prep took a momentary lead as Jack
Miller won the 50-yard dash in the fast
ume of 262 seconds; however, the
Pennsylvania club came back to gain
a 10-8 margin when Hyman's strong
finish nosed out Ralph Ruocco in the
100-yard breast stroke event. George
School continued to set the pace when
Green and Taggert finished 1-2 in the
tiring 220-yard free style swim. Ray
Ries, Prep entrant, took third place.
An unusual even which occurred in
the Back Stroke helped the Prep mer-
men. Darlington, who finished second
for George, was climinated for not
touching the end of the pool with his
hand before pushing off. This moved
Stan Geipel and Joe Cramer into sec-
ond and third places respectively. The
score stood at this time at 23 to 13,
in favor of the Keystoners, and the
Prepsters saw it necessary to cut down
the lead.

Len Waterman showed his heels to
Diament and Thomas of George in tak-
ing the 100-yard dash in a crack time
of 59.9 seconds. Piffath and Rolfe con-
tinued Prep’s late rally when they
Garnered six points by taking first and
third in the Fancy Diving, and cutting
George School's edge to 3 to 24; how-
ever, the Pennsylvania club clinched
the meet when they beat Prep’s 150-yard

 

 

medigy com of Cramer, Ruocco,
and “Manning. Prep won ‘the final
event, the 220-yard relay. Piffath,

Manning, Miller and Waterman did it
in a tempo of 1.49.

Despite the fact that they lost the
meet, Prep should not be discouraged;
Miller and Waterman should be con-
sistent winners in the sprints, and Man-
ning also showed great promise. Joe
Piffath and Harry Rolfe may "be
counted on to held their monopoly on
the dives, while points from some of
the other men should make the Prep-
sters into consistent winners.

dent, Manuel Prado, this element is
gradually being weeded out.

Peru is not completely democratic,
because many of the people can neither
read nor write; about one-third are
literate. We would call Peru a ben-
evolent despotism. It is necessary that
the government be in. strong hands;
otherwise there would be revolutions
on every side. Moreover, the people
and the land would be exploited by
every schemer who came along

In Lima, Dick said, a typical day
begins about eight A. M. At one o'clock

everything stops for a four hours’
siesta. After the siesta, shoppers
throng to the stores. Supper, which

is the largest meal of the day, is served
at nine P. M. Peruvian night-life be-

Although many of us would like to |
be carried back to The Rutgers Gram-
mar School as it was called just before
the advent of Dr. Demarest, there is
a somber note here. The teachers at
this time were very severe. Dr. Dema

Johnston, who although he was very
brilliant was also very austere. The
chief form of punishment was staying

physical means were used, and they
proved highly satisfactory.

cheek, one of Olivia's suitors is angered |
because Olivia has fallen in love with
Vic and he challenges Viola to a |
duel. Viola manages to avoid the duel
without losing her honor, and then
Sebastian, Viola's brother, whom she
had thought was dead, appears and
confuses things because he looks a

great deal like his sister, especially since
she is disguised like a man. Soon after,
Viola is revealed as a girl and the
Duke realizes that he is in love with
her.

The acting in the play is superb.
Helen Hayes is persuasive in the part
of Viola and in her usual fine manner
she does justice to her role. Maurice |
Evans in the part of Malvolio is ex- |
cellent. This part is not a major
one in the play, but with Evans play-
ing the part, it has become one of the
most important. The rest of the cast
is also fine. Several of the sequences
of the play are very amusing, especially |
the scene of the duel between Viola
and Sir Andrew Aguecheek. This play,
one of the finest of Shakespeare's
works, has been made into an excellent
stage version at the St. James Theatre
in New York Cit

England though battered and rammed
unmercifully, has remained steadfast
under the impact, and at the present
ie is even beg: ing to turn the tide
own favor—a possibility which
ed very remote a few months ago.
British troops are sweeping Africa free
of Italians—they have already captured
the important cities of Bardia, and
Tobruk, another important town, is
about to fall at any moment. The little
Greek force, which no one expected
to amount to much, has not only
stemmed the Italian advance, but has

Italy.

Not only abroad but also in our
country many momentous events have
occurred. President Roosevelt has
been elected for a third term; an event
unrivaled in the history of the nation
since the days of George Washington,
who first set the precept of no third
term. Perhaps even greater than that
is the advent of peacetime conscription,
another event that has never before
happened in America.

‘These are only a few of the great
happenings of the past year. While
they have affected few of us to any
great degree, their results will affect
us all, and history will call this a
stirring a period as that of the First
World War.

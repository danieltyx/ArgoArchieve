This summer the masters of the Rut-
gers Preparatory School took their well
earned vacations in a variety of ways.
Some were counselers at boy's camps,
some took up post-graduate studies, and
some just played. At any rate, all must
have enjoyed themselves, since they all
seem to be in the best of spirits.

Mr. Stanley Shepard, our headmaster,
and Mrs. Shepard spent the summer
on Cape Cod. At this ideal recreatio
place the Shepards indulged in swim-
ming, boating and fishing, while in
residence at their retreat.

The master of romance languages did
a great deal of travelling in his Black
Beauty. He toured the Southwest and
the Plains of Anahuac. The Grand Can-
yon Mr. Roy found to be so deep that
he did not care to venture to the brink,

the Rio Grande we find him scouring
the plains to Mexico City. There he
saw the castle of Maxmilian, Chapul-
tepec, and the floating gardens nearby.
South of the capital Mr. Roy climbed

graphed Popocatepetel. On the way

Travelling in the Caribbean Sea
helped to pass the recess months for
Mr. and Mrs. Rudy. Their odyssey took
them to Cuba and to Kingston, Ja-

with the natives. Thence they sailed to
Sangoelaya, Honduras. There they
found a small but thriving port city.
It seemed like a small jewel set at the
bottom of some cyclop’s crown. Fifteen
miles inland is the farthest one may
travel in that direction, after that the
terrain is completely impassable.

For three days last summer Mr. and
Mrs. Matthews were marooned on their
father’s farm because of an electrical
storm. This was only the beginning of
the season, but it didn’t dampen their
spirits. Later they went to the beach at
Ocean Park and went swimming when
the weather permitted. In between
times they played tennis, a favorite di-
version.

School Spirit Seems To Be
On Upward Trend; New
Masters On Staff

The Rutgers Preparatory School
commenced its 176th year with an en-
rollment of cecighty-five students. A
little less than half of this number are
boarding boys, most of whom hail from
New York and New Jersey, with a
small sprinkling of boys from more
distant states. Since this number is less

 

    

 

than last yea enrollment, is now
possible to hold all classes the main
recitation building. Last was

  

necessary to hold two classes in the
elementary school.

Heralded this year by all as a great
step forward is the Coco-Cola vendor in
the cellar of the Delta House. Besides
providing refreshment for weary talk-
ers and those exhausted by even onlay
it also has another virtue, for
ceeds-are to1g0 to the athletieifund of
the school. Therefore it is urged that
all and sundry drink Coca-Cola. Surely,
here is a very easy method in which to
demonstrate school spirit-

In place of the three departed mem-
bers of last year’s faculty, two new men
have joined the teaching staff. Taking
his place as head of the English de-
partment is Mr. John Hunter, who
came to Rutgers Prep from Nyack
High School in New York State. Out-
side of his English classes Mr. Hunter
will be the faculty adviser for various
extra-curricular activities of the school,
namely the two school literary publica~
tions; The Argo, our school newspaper,
and Ye Dial, the yearbook. Mr. Hunter

 

 

also is the sponsor of the Theatre Club
and has aroused the interest of the
student body in the Rutgers Concert
Series.

The advanced fourth-year English
class, under the supervision of Mr.
Hunter, attended a pair of lectures Fri-
day, October 10, held in connection
with the 175th anniversary of Rutgers
University. The first of the lectures,
which took place in the Rutgers Gym-
nasium, was that of Maxwell Anderson,
the famous American playwright, au-
thor of “Elizabeth The Queen” and
“Candle In The Wind,” which has just
opened on Broadway Mr. Anderson’s
treatise was entitled “The Basis for
Artistic Creation in Literature.” Since
Mr. Anderson was unable to be present,
his son Quentin Anderson of Columbia
University read the lecture for him.

Mr. Anderson spoke of the theatre as
a religious thing and of the actors and
actresses as priests and priestesses. He
pointed out that the theatre has cer-
tain standards to uphold. Good must

that the opposite can not be true. He
cited as an example the fact that a

addition, Mr. Anderson mentioned sev-

in every play, namely that the plot must
be one that goes on in the minds of
men and women, and that the hero must
be a better man in the end of the play
than he was at the beginning. He adde:
that there were qualities which every
character in the play must possess to be
popular with the audience; in a man,
strength and firmness of conviction, in
a woman, fidelity. He said that the op-

Here at Rutgers Mr. Hunter teaches
five English classes. Also, he has charge
of the Theatre Club, the Concert Series,

Mr. Hunter has a delightful sense of

lover, a theatre goer, an amateur actor,
and a patron of the arts.

Mr. Gariss has A.B. and M.E.D. de-
grees from Rutgers University, and an
A.M. degree from Columbia University.
He also has a certificate from the Jena
Universitat, which is located in the
province of Thuringia in Germany. He
was a physical director in the Paterson,
New Jersey, Y. M. C. A. Before com-
ing to the Rutgers peetiee School,
he was an instructor in German and
director of boys athletics at the Kew-
Forest School in Forest Hills, Long
Island.

From 1926 to 1930 Mr. Gariss was
the Senior Metropolitan A. A. U. Tum-
bling Champion. In 1927 he was the
New Jersey State Inter-Scholastic
Tumbling Champion, and in 1930 he
was a runner up in the Senior Na-
tional A.A.U. Tumbling Meet. He was,
in 1929, the Eastern Collegiate Diving
Champion, and he won the Inter-Col-
legiate Diving Championship in 1930.
He was also the head chectieader at
Rutgers University in 1930 and

This year, beside teaching all sor our
Latin classes, Mr. Gariss plays the
piano at morning assemblies and
coaches the J. V. football team. Stu-
dents of the Boarding School have
heard his accomplished “boogie-woogie”
style on the piano and have a sample
of his gymnastic abilities. We can say
that Mr. Gariss has balance not only
as a gymnast but also as a teacher.

INSINCERITY IN HIGH PLACES

“Few people who say that it is sweet to die for one’s country
have ever done so.” This is the statement which in the last issue of
the Saturday Evening ost began an article by W. L. White, son ot
William Allen White, editor ot the well-known journal, The Emporia
Gazette of Emporia, Kansas.

Perhaps this statement is an excuse on the part of Mr. White
that he is quite unwilling to die for his country. If Mr. White did mean
this solely as an excuse, one which no one can blame him for giving,
he has skipped over one of the greatest crimes of our age. This crime
occurs mostly on Independance Day, Armistice Day, Columbus Day
and other such national holidays. For the most part it is committed by
our better known figures, namely politicians, who in committing this

crime reduce themselves to petty, bombastic individuals. :

This crime to which I am referring is that tendency of certain
persons to proclaim their willingness to die for their country. Un-
tortunately this crime has never been exposed simply because there
are few people who are willing to admit that they are unwilling
to die for their country.

This statement has been used so many times that it has become
the trademark of cheap politicians. We have heard it so much that
it has become a trifle boring. As a matter of fact, it was boring as far
back as 1902 when Phillip Brett changed it by saying that he would
die for dear old Rutgers. The veracity of this statement is a little
more than doubted.

Nonetheless as much as we seem to doubt the truth of such a
statement, it seems that in order to be successful, a politician must be
willing “to die for his country.”

Perhaps the day will come when we can see if these persons are as
good as their word.

The Gentle Art of Thumb Twiddling

Killing time is an art in itself. The average person, when faced
with the prospect of nothing to do for a couple of hours, usually just
sits and gapes. Such a situation is quite often found in a doctor's of-
fice, where the only way to while away the years is to peruse the un-
interesting pages of the American Medical Journal, or some other
ghastly magazine of the same type. In this little lesson I will try
to remedy that defect.

The best way to start is to learn thumb-twiddling. This will not
only lead to digital dexterity, but, if it is continued for a long enough
time, St. Vitus Dance. Therefore, the aspirant should read each sen-
tence carefully, and not try to get ahead of the class, since calamity
will inevitably follow.

Before starting on the lesson proper, there are one or two very
necessary preliminaries. These are place of practice, and position of
the body. As noise and other commotion are disastrous to perfection
in this, as in other fields of endeavour, I would recommend some quiet
and rather dull place—such as an English class. The body should be
in a slouched, completely relaxed position, with the spine forming a
half-moon shape. Once the beginner has got, or has been placed, in
the aforesaid position, we are ready to begin at last.

Place the hands loosely clasped on the lap, leaving the thumbs
free. Then start moving the thumbs in a circular movement, both
going the same speed and in the same direction.

As the student will become rather dizzy if this is continued for
too long a time, it is a good idea to reverse their motion about every

CAPTAIN PAUL
By COMMANDER EDWARD
ELLSBERG

Literary Guild of America

Of the many historical novels, good,
bad, and indifferent, published in re-
cent years, few have been as interest-

gas the new life of John Paul Jones
which was brought out this year. From
start to finish there is little boredom
and much action. Drawn from authentic
sources with meticulous care, it pre-
sents an accurate and exceedingly vivid
picture of one of America’s great lead-
ers.

Commander Ellsberg i eptionally
fell fitted for a task of this sort as hi
previous novels, most of them best-
sellers, show. It was he who brought
to life the struggles of the crew of the
ill-fated “Jeanette,” lost in the arctic
wastes, in “Hell On Ice," and _ his
famous story “On the Bottom, dealing
with life on board a submarine, is in
almost every library of any size in the
country. Nor does his latest produc-
tion fail to “toe the mark.” On the con-
trary, it is one of the most fascinating
biographies we have read in many a
long month.

The story is written through the eyes
and ears of Tom Folger, a young Nan-
tucketer, who is thrown in with Jones
during most of the latter's career. Tom
is planning to enter the printing trade
as an apprentice to Benjamin Franklin,
who is a second cousin, but Tom i
hindered from this by the death of his
father. Feeling obliged to begin earn-
ing money, he ships out to sea as a
common seaman on a whaling vessel.
The life is more rigorous than he had

sighted, he is wiry and fit. This whale,
however, instead of being a_ piece |
good luck, proves to be a definite evil,
for with a couple of slaps of its tail,
it stoves in the whaling dinghy contain-
ing the officers and sinks it. This leaves
the ship with only the petty officers
in command.

Since Tom is the only person on
board with any knowledge of mathe-
matics, he is promoted to the position

 

 

 

 

of third mate so that he may learn navi-
gation. He picks up enough to limp the
ship into the nearest port, and there
goes on board a neighboring vessel to
get help in navigation. The captain
proves to be John Paul Jones. While
these two are discussing navigation, one
of the latter’s crew mutinies, and the
captain is forced to kill him in self
defense.

Finding the shore authorities to be
on the crew's side in the affair, Captain
Paul is forced to flee. Because Tom
helps him at this, Jones later gives him
a place on his boat. This is the be-
ginning of a long friendship, and when,
after m: adventures, the Revolu-
tionary War begins, they both fight for
the establishment of a colonial navy.
Unfortunately, there is much political
interference with this, and only after
miany weary months of waiting is the
vote put through, Even then permis-
sion is given only to sail up and down
the coast line in search of enemy ves-
sels, but this is important, for Captain
Paul makes coup after coup with amaz-
ing effrontery and audacity until he be-
comes an enemy to be reckoned with.

The crowning point of the story
comes, however, when he is finally per-
mitted to carry the war into British
home waters, giving them a taste of
their own medicine. He becomes such
a menace to shipping that even with
naval convoys merchants are no longer
willing to send their goods by boat.
The English, hampered by the actions
of that “Yankee Jackanapes,” sent a
number of men-of-war to rid the seas

In spite of political unfairness, in

and in spite of the lack of recognition
which was his due, John Paul Jones
fought onwards toward an America free
from the chains of royalty and petty
tyranny. In our opinion he was one of
America’s greatest patriots, a man most
influential in the formation of our pres-

The Theatre Club,
the direction of Mr. unter, is appar-
ently ready to enjoy most success-
ful season both from the standpoint of
the number and quality of the plays to
be attended and from the standpoint of
the number of boys who have shown a
desire to attend the Broadway produc-
tions,

Already Mr. Hunter has been able
to secure tickets for “Candle In the
Wind” written by the noted American
dramatist Maxwell Anderson. Although
the play opened only a week ago, it
seems certain to be a hit. The play has
received excellent reviews from the
New York critics and the cast is headed
by one of Broadway's greatest per-
formers, Helen Hayes. The plot of the
play deals with the fall of France and
life under the Nazi regime. The club
expects to attend the production on
November 14.

Two weeks later the club will at-
tend the hilarious new comedy “Best
Foot Forward.” The comedy was writ-
ten by George Abbott and features
lovely Rosemary Lane as its leading
actress. Miss Lane will be supported
by a youthful cast, the majority of
which have had no previous experience
on the professional stage. The plot has
to do with a prep school dance and
presents many amusing situations which
are handled well by the inexperienced
cast.

POWERFUL MORRISTOWN JUGGERNAUT
ROLLS OVER PREPSTERS, 31 TO 0

Rutgers Prep was overpowered by
a far superior and more experienced
Morristown eleven, as the 1941 football
season was opencd on the Rutgers
Stadium field.

The Prepsters never had a chance
once the upstate boys cut loose with
their big guns. Coach Charles Nevin's
chargers scored once in the first period,
twice in the second, and added a pair
of six pointers in the fourth. Prep’s bids
for a score came in the last half of
the third quarter and midway through
the fourth quarter. Both times, how-
ever, the Morristown team rallied to
beat back the invaders.

The first period saw a valiant Prep
team shatter to pieces as the Crimson
and White turned on the pressure and
scored as a_result of an cighty-yard
march. Bill Elsaesser received the hon-
ors when he scored standing up on a
wide end run. Prep took the offensive
when Gordon Dunham and Bob Dem-
ing each carried the pigskin for ten-
yard gains. However, this drive was
quickly checked and the period ended
Morristown 6, Prep 0.

At the opening of the second quarter,
Shultz, on a double reverse scored from
the Prepsters’ twenty yard stripe. The
Little Scarlet fought back desperately,
sparked by Al Evans’ return of a kick-
off for twenty-two yards, but to no

At the opening of the second half,
Morristown again began to move and
would have tallied had it not been for
Danny Williams, who intercepted one
of Elsaesser’s passes and returned it
ten yards up the field. On the next
play Johnny Linder passed to “Brud”

to dock and find his tire flat.

Mr. Petke taught athletics to a group
of boys at a camp on Cape Cod where
he has been during previous years. He
enja himself thoroughly, but is glad
to be back to his own team and his own
classes.

The lady of books, pencils, theatre
tickets, and allowances, Mrs. Andrews,
is back at her station in the office after
a most delightful tour through Con-

and looked at the ocean, Among the

Lace,” which she didn’t like very much,
and “The Little Foxes,” with which
she was pleased no end.

to Dunham for a total gain of thirty
yards. But once more this drive wa
checked and in being checked seemed
to take all the offensive punch out of
Coach Petke's squad. Inspired by hard
running Ed McKnight, Morristown
forced its way down field and added
another score. As the quarter came to
an end, Johnny Linder uncorked a
twenty yard pass to Williams who
raced fifteen more before being brought
down on the Morristown twenty-eight
yard line. Here the Prepsters were
stopped cold and Morristown took over.

In the final period, two costly fum-
bles and an intercepted pass for a
touchdown reduced the Prepsters’ fight-
ing spirit to utter despair. The game
ended as Shultz crossed the goal line
after intercepting one of John Linder’s
desperation heaves for a score.

ALUMNI NEWS

Of late some of our former students
have returned to visit us or have sent us
information concerning themselves. We
are always glad to hear what the Prep
boys of other years are doing and how
they have fared since they left our
school.

Robert Knox, who last year was a
junior, is now in Drake College here
in New Brunswick.

John Henry Cook, '34, was married
on the sixth of September. He and his
wife are now living in New York City.

Philip Uhrig, '37, who is now living
in Tucson, Arizona, was married last
June.

Many of the four-year boys will re-
member Roy Stogner, '39, since he was
one of the guiding lights of this journal.
He paid the school a visit when he
came east last month. Chicago is his
present home.

Carteret Defeats

2 Costly Fumbles

Minute, Tally Again
In 2nd Period

 

 

Carteret School, taking full advantage
of every Prep misplay, struck swiftly
and effectively on two Rutgers Prep
fumbles and escaped with a 12 to
victory on Neilson Field on October
17. This is the second setback for the
Prepsters in as many starts. Bad breaks
and inability to get really started seems
to have been the main trouble.

The Orange eleven, sparked by a
triple-threat star. Bill Burke, whose
father is the coach, scored its first
touchdown on the second play of the
game. The opening kickoff was taken
by quaterback “Gus” Gustafson deep
in his own end zone, but in attempting

ve through three Carteret tacklers,
fumbled on the three-yard line
and Bob Burton recovered for Carteret.
On the next play Burke scored on an
off tackle run. The Burke to Burton
pass combination proved to be the en-
tire Carteret offensive power.

Early in the second quarter Allen
recovered a Prep fumble on the home
team thirty-five yard stripe. Taking ad-
vantage of a weak Prep pass defense,
Burke passed to Palmer for 15 yards.
Six plays later Burton crossed on an
end around play with a whole host of
blockers leading the way. Several times
the Brunswick boys showed their
power, but to no advantage in the
score column. Bill Vogelsang stood out
on the Little Scarlet line along with

The Prepsters held the visitors in
complete control throughout the entire
second half. However, they themselves
were held at bay. Once, late in the third
period, Coach_ Petke’s eleven drove
down to the Carteret thitry-yard line,
but a fifteen-yard penalty for holding
placed them back out of scoring range
for the remainder of the game.

Farkas, Lambert
And Beardslee
Take Over Reins

Students Vote $3.50 Per
Semester Into Fund,
Farkas President

 

The new Student Association of Rut-
gers Prep School, formed at the in-
stigation of Mr. Shepherd, held its first
meeting on October 17 to make plans
for the new y The results of the
student election, held last year, were
announced, and ideas for extra-curric-
ular activitics decided upon,

In the past, there has been little or-
ganizine worth speaking of, and those
few officers who there were, not only
came only from the senior class, but
also performed nothing whatsoever ex-
cept at graduation time. This year, how-
ever, a new arrangement has been put
into effect. The major change is that
a president was elected for each of the
lower classes, which will not only have
y in the student administration, but
| also provide officers for the com-
ing year. In a general election held at
the end of last year the five officers who
now “reign supreme” were chosen. Dick
Farkas, popular athlete and sports edi-
tor of “The Argo,” was chosen to be
president of the senior class, Fred Lam-
bert became vice- president, and David
Beardslee is the secretary-treasurer.
Tom Bishop and Philip Reugger pre-
side over the sophomore and junior
classes.

It was decided that three dollars and
a half should be levied from each boy
in school to provide a working fund
for the group and that this money
should be spent only upon approval of
the school body as a whole. One use
to which this fund will be put will be
the school dances, of which three have
been planned, although no dance com-
mittee has as » formed. It is
also thought th t might be util-

 

 

  

 

  

   

 

 

 

  

have during the course of the
year. This portends to be one of the
most successful and excellent associa-
tions that the school has ever had, and
one from which we may expect much.

   

 

OPENING OF SCHOOL

A week later than usual, a delay
which wrecked little havoc in ‘the minds
of the students, the portals of Rutgers
Preparatory School opened on Septem
ber 23, 1941, to admit the student body.

The enrollment is down to 85 stu-
dents, due to a depreciation in the
amount of day boys. The boarding
school, however, has the same number
of students as last year.

There will be one less member of the
teaching staff this year. The Messrs.
Stearns, McClintock and Simpson have
gone to other fields of endeavor, but
their places will be ably filled by Mr.
Gariss and Mr, Hunter. Otherwise the
remainder of last year’s masters are
returning. Mr. Hunter has already un-
dertaken the trying duties of he
Argo” and the Theatre Club while Mr.
Gariss has been drilling the Junior
Varsity football squad which seems
ready for a successful season under its
new mentor.

Through general observation we
would say that school spirit is on an
upward trend. Great interest has been
shown in the student association, and
the football team has received the com-
plete backing of the student body. Des-
pite the fact that the team has been
unsuccessful in its first two starts, a
noiceably larger number of boys have
attended the games than last year.

On the whole we are settling down
after vacation activities, glad to replace
them with the work which comes with
school.

Here’s to a bigger and better year
for Rutgers Prep.

team and he will be counted on to help
with the other athletic teams.
Otherwise the men on_ the faculty
are the same as last year. The man who
comes in contact with the most mem-
bers of the student body is the head of
the math department, Mr. Guy F. Blake.
The French, German, and Spanish in-
structors of the school are Mr. Archie,
F. Roy, Mr. Walter G. Petke, and Mr.
Benjamin A. Matthews, respectively.
Mr. Petke is also the biology instructor
nd Mr. Matthews also helps in_the
glish department by teaching
lish to a class of English IL. Mr.
dreas Z. Holley is the instructor of the
history courses. Mr. Harry E. Rudy is
not only the school registrar, but he
also is the teacher of the nces, chem-
istry and physics, and several sections

that the English department under the
direction of Mr. Hunter could place
the boys more intelligently and make
it possible to have a fast and a slow
group in all three classes.
In the field of sports, the Rutgers

season is well under way with the var-
sity ng played two games and the

 

date of the opening jayvee game ap-
proaching closer. For a second year,
Mr. Matthews had his microbes out on
the gridiron fighting for the honor of
the school.

The winter sports of the school will
be varsity. and jayvee _ basketball
coached by Mr. Petke and Mr. Blake,
respectively, and swimming coached by

Mr. Holley. When spring rolls around,
Rutgers Prep will have four different
sports to occupy their time. For the

CONCERT SERIES
(Continued from Page 1)

To top off this series, there is, as
usual, the Boston Symphony Orchestra,
under the direction of Serge Kousse-
vitzky. This, according to the world-
famous Oscar Levant, is the finest or-
chestra in the world today, surpassing
such outstanding groups as the
New York Philharmonic and the Lon-
don Philharmonic. Thus there ends a
great concert series with a truly great
orchestra.

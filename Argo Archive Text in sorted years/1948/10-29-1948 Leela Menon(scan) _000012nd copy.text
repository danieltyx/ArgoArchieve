VETERANS
DANCE A SUCCESS !

_ Last Saturday night, October 16,
‘Would be hayseeds, and the poten~
tial farmers group", met for a
real old fashioned barn dance.
Under the glowing influence of the
un-spiked apple cider and dough-
nuts, the plaid shirted, and blue
jeaned couples, skipped, ran,
jumped and crawled around our
"farm decorated" gymnasium, to the
tune of Turkey in the Straw.
Dunking for apples was a favorite
pastime among the farmers, while
the farmerettes went for the
apples on the string in a big way.
To top off a wonderful evening a
very good square dance orchestra
from Somerville provided the music.

ADVISE GRADUATES-—

SERVICE OR COLLEGE ?

In various issues of the Argo
we are going to ask questions of
the students here at Prep. In this
way we will be able to see what
Prepsters think about various
things of interest, This week our
question is: "After your experi-
ence in the armed forces, would you
advise the members of the senior
class to enter service immediately
after graduation, or to enter
college and wait to be drafted".
This question was asked only of
veterans, Of the seven veterans
approached, 4 were in favor of go-
ing into the service, and 3 for
going to college.

1. Ed Ostrowski--I would advise
that they enter the service and
get it over with, for if you
entered a college now you proba-
bly would be drafted,

John Hess--I think that for the
average student it would be wiser
to enter college after graduation
from Prep School.
3S. Jim Moran--I didn't have much

of a choice a few years ago, but

I would still rather enter the

service and be done with it,

4, Ed Orlowski--Go into the ser-
vice and get it over with, Being
a veteran, I know what went on
and would recommend it to those
who are in the same boat.

Dick Gumerlock-eI believe it
would be better to enter the
service and be done with it.
Then your college education will
not be interrupted. See page 3.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

So that you will have a chance
to submit new ideas, add informa-
tion as a follow up on articles,
congratulate or condemn us, we are
starting a "Letters to the Editor"
column. We hope that you will sup-
port this column for it will add
to your interest in the paper. To
start off our new section here is
a recent letter received from the
upper floor residents of the Bota
House:

 

 

Dear Sirs:

Regarding your article on "The
Traps", your reporter made the
statement that the Beta House was
quiet this year. We may be few in
number, but the statement that we
are quict is a gross misrepresen-
tation of fact, as Mr. Blake and
plaster on his floor will testify.

Yours, for more accu-
rate reporting, D. Me, Be De, A. Avy
He. Me, J. H., and R. D.

£0. Rep. Being rushed for space
and time, the author of the article
"The Traps", quite unintentionally
cast a slur ovor the Beta House.
However, to rectify the mistake,

rial from the houso occupants, will

~~” THEATRE CLUB

In this paper, we of the Argo
staff try to write articles that
are timely, interesting, and not
repetitious. Also, in our editor-
ials we try to use the same policy.
The editorial this issue has to do
with an old standby at Prep, the
Theatre Club. Last season the
theatre club was discontinued for
many varied reasons, however, this
year we of the Argo would like to
see it revived, for we feel that it
adds a certain something to the
school life that cannot be gotten
anywhere else. I have spoken to
Ir, Downie about a renewal of the
theatre club, and asked him exactly
what his opinion is. The following
are his comments:

you ask me about a theatre clubJ
Well, I can't sing the praises of
such an idea too loudly. I think
every momber of the student body
should consider joining such a
group. I feel the theatre has a
definite part to play in one's
education, Think how lucky we are
to have the theatrical center of
the world in our own backyard, so
to speak. I always am thrilled
when one of the grceat stage person-
alities steps out, and holds an
entire audience, including myself,
for an entire performance, That,
my friends, is an oxperience never
to be forgotten, If you have
never soon a broadway show, you
have beon missing plonty. Let's
soo if wo can't revive the theatre
club and make it possible for us
once again to seo the great shows
on Broadway, as a group",

Rather than write any more we feel
that this past article has done
sufficient. Now let's get out and
organize a theatre club again,

GINELLO —ROSS|
COACH JVs

The J. Ve. football squad has
been working very hard since the
proper coaching staff was obtained.
Although they went to practice at
the beginning of school, the J. V.'s
did not really learn football until
they got tho coaching of William
Ginello and Frank Rossi, both
Rutgers University students. The
first week tho J. V. team learned
only the fundamentals, such as
proper stance, pulling out of a
line, etc.. The second week con-
sisted of tackling and blocking.
Tho more important work took place
during the third week, They learned
difforont plays, and the balance and
unbalanced lines. The membors of
tho J. Ve squad are: in the lino:
Ray Henderson, Francis Stokes, Alan
Cameron, Charles Tucker, Bernard
Rinoberg, Bill Cramer, Bob Lockhart,
Hans doBlecourt, Richie Cmnolly,
Bob Linn, Gene Ginsberg, and Irwin
Roth. In tho backfield: Ed Janata,
Jim Allen, Jack Anderson, and John
Edgar, Hcre's hoping that the J,
V.'s will havo as successful a
season as the varsity are having.

PREP-29 HUN-6

Before an enthusiastic crowd of
100, the maroon and white, defeat-
ed Hun School by a score of 29-6.
The first touchdown occurred in
the first quarter, when on five
plays Prep advanced from their own
39 yard line to the Hun 2 yard
marker. After being set back to
the 7 yard line by an offside
penalty, Dick Gumerlock went over
for the first Prep tally, Bill
Driscoll converted and made the
score 7-0, At the beginning of
the second quarter, Bob Buchfield
of Hun threw a pass, but it was
intercepted by John Garboski, who
then went over for the second
touchdown. Bill Driscoll again
converted, and we went ahead 14-0.
% tackle by Orlowski and Veros in
*he end zone ran the score up to
6-0, The next touchdown effected
with comparative ease almost turn-
ed the game into an uninteresting
show of power. But the kick was
no good and the score remained
22-0, The last T. D. for Prep
occurred in the third period. Prep
however, did not escape unscathed
on this one, and Frank Powell was
carried from the field with torn
ligaments in his knee. When Coach
Fousman put in his second and ,
thira teams, Hun marched 75 yards
for their first and only touchdown,
Their placement however was bad,
and Prep won 29-6. Our hats are
off to Gorman, Gumerlock, Driscoll,
and Powell.

PREP at ST. PETERS-O

‘

Rutgers Prep defeated St. Peters
High School in a night game at the
Municipal Stadium by a score of
7-0, On a md soaked field, and
without the able assistance of Dick
Gumerlock, John Garboski, Ed
Orlowski, and Charlie Papp, the
Maroon and White prought the ball
down into the end zone in the third
period against a stubborn St.Peter's
eleven, giving Prep its third con-
secutive victory.

The first half was played mostly
in St. Peter's territory and many
times in striking distance of a
touchdown; but, the Cardinals'
fighting qualities kept the ball
from going over, and the first half
ended with the ball in Prep's hands
on the opponent's 12 yard line.

The Cardinals! kick off in the
3rd period was returned by Marty
Waldman to his own 28 yard line.
Prep then drove to their own 42
yard line and Lou Vasvary puntede
With the ball in St. Peter's pos-
session, Ed Ryan fumbled and Jim
Efinger recovered the ball deep in
Cardinal territory. A series of
plays by Harry Veros, Marty Waldman,
Tom Beaudette, and Karl Schreefer
brought the ball down to the % yard
line. Then Schreefer sliced off
tackle for the score. Bill ~
Driscoll's conversion made it 7-0.

In the fourth period St. Peter's
showed offensive power, but a fumble
cost them their chance of scoring.
The last part of the game was high-
lighted by St. Peter's aerial
attack. The game ended with the
ball in St. Potor's possession on
their own 35 yard line.

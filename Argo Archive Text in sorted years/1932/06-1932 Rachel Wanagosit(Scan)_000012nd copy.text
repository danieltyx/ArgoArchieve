THE LAST MILE

We have reached the time of the year
which tends to brighten and dampen our
spirits at the same instant. Graduation
means more than the advancement from
secondary school to college; it means the
loss of friendship. Too brief is the time
spent in prep school among our familiars,
and it is a hard blow to realize that after
today we are climbing different paths;
paths which may never aga-n cross.

The memories of the pleasant hours is
the only recompense for this heart ache.
To think back upon the joys and tribula-
tions of former days is an extreme delight.
But, to meet again and exchange views 15
far greater than any recollection.

The Argo pleads for a stronger alumni
association. We fear that not enough
emphasis has been placed upon this subject.
There is absolutely no conceivable reason
why Rutgers Prep, after 166 years of exist-
ence, should not have one of the strongest
alumni groups in the country.

The seniors who will today say their last
farewells should undertake to form among
themselves an association; perhaps one
which will meet regularly every year. If
it is impossible to so reorganize the whole
graduate group in this manner, at least
here in 1932 we shall have the cornerstone
of a memorial building; a building that may
live only in our hearts,

BASEBALL SEASON
WAS HIGH SUCCESS
DUE TO MANY WINS

Prep Downs Princeton in Medinere Games;
Ha sy senile wae Longest Ever Made
On Princeton Diamond
On May 21, the Rutgers Prep baseball |

team travelled to Princeton where they de

feated the highly touted Princeton Prep
team hy the score 15-2 Lina pitched a ne
hit game for the Maroon and White, The
Tiger cubs tried three pitchers but to no
avail. Grossman, Jablonsky, Lins, and
Klaver starred at bat and in the field, Rut
gers Prep collected fifteen hits among which
were doubles by Groceman, Keating, Lins
Fertig, Braido, and homers by Pennington
and Jablonsky. Jablonsky's homer was the
longest hit ever made on the Princeton field,
The ball was not even found although a
search of ten minutes was made,

On May 17 the Prep team took on the
Rutgezs Frosh at Neilson Field and trounced
them to the tune of 7-0, Jablonsky pitched
a one-hit game, It was a good ball_ game
played under sultry weather cond.tions,
Klauer, Lins, and Pennington starred at bat,
while Jablonsky, Lins and Pennington
starred in the field,

Newark Walked Over

On May 14, the Maroon and White
team travelled to Newark whe e they de-

feated Newark Academy in a thirteen in-
Tn Z game by the score of 9-6. “This wa’
a very exciting game and it had the rooters
on their feet yelling almcst every minute.
Lins pitched for Rutgers and st-uck out 18
men, while Taylor, who pitched for the
Newarkers struck out 19. There were
numerous errozs by both sides in the game.
Lins, Pennington and Grossman starred at
bat with three hits apiece. Moe got two
doubles and a triple while Lins got a home
run and two singles, Coehendet starred for
the Newarkers with a double and a single
out of six times at bat. Roy Lins pitched
fine ball but due to faulty support was put
in many holes that he had trouble in getting
out.

Shower Dampens Spirits

On May 11, the Maroon and White
travelled to Plainfield where they engaged
the Wardlaw School by the score of 7-0.
Jablonsky pitched fine ball allowing only
one hit and no runs, This game was fairly
interesting, but was played during a shower
which made it unpleasant for both the
players and the spectators.

Due to the fact that exams came so early,
it was necessary for Prep to cancel the New-
ton Academy game. Had this vame been
held, it would have been impossible for a
number of seniors to have participated, for

 

numerous reasons,

tory of Haters Prep

Led by Captain Hobert Linders, the Pays
ger team captured first place in every run
ning event Linders, whe won the 100 and
220 yard dashes and the broad jump, was
by far the outstanding star of the meet. [ny
the 220 yard dish, running the most re
markable race of career, he set a new State
high and prep school record of 217.7 sec
mds. His time for the hundred yard dash
was 10.1 seconds. Both these races he won
by several yards, Then his second trial, he
won the running broad jump with a dis
tance of 20 ft. BVz inches

Following the example set by Linders,
Charles Stengel defending his own title,
captured first in the 440 yard dash. Then
Tem O'Donnell, middle d'stance ace, cap-
tured first in the 880 yard run, O'Donnell
set a new class B prep school record with
the except‘onally good time of 2 minutes
and 6 seconds, Miller placed third in the
same event,

A particularly interesting pe formance
was the mile run in which Rutgers Prep
made a clean sweep. Pend'eton was
an easy victor with Charles Smith and
Charles Wenz capturing second and third
places respectively. The time was 5 min-
utes 4 seconds. Paul Wehr, a new addition
to the team, made a fine showing by win-
ning second place in the shot

Rutgers Prep has made a brilliant show-
ing in every meet this year. On April 22,
the first meet was held at Lawrenceville.
The star of this meet was Bob Linders who
captured first place in the 100 and 220 yard
dashes and the discus throw. Other out-
standing performances at this time were
those of Stengel and O'Donnell who cap-
tured second places in the 440 and 880
respectively. Out of six schools participat-

We have some well-lked faculty mem-

been willing to assist the boys in whatever
way possible, and Mrs, Thatcher's delight-
ful smile and cheery greeting have bright-

F. Pattberg who spent th’s very pleasant

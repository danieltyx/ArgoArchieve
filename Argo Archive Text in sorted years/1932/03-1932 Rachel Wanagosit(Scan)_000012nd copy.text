ON “DIAL” QUESTION

Students and Faculty Disagree on Possibility

Of Year Book success; Statements
Point Toward Failure

 

The question of the publication of “Ye

Dial", Rutgers Prep yearbook, was re-
opened last week when Headmaster William
P. Kelly presented before the student body
two estimates which had been sent him.
Both estimates were prepared upon the
basis that all unecessary and feature mater-
ial was to be omitted. The lowest figure
submitted was by Heidingsfeld Company of
New Brunswick.

Much criticism and support has been

evident about the school in regard to the

publication of this yearbook, and in the

hope that it might help decide the question,

The Argo interviewed several members of

the faculty and student body. From these

interviews many helpful suggestions were

Several boys proposed benefit games in
basketball and baseball; others requested
student subscriptions. The general opinion
of The Argo staff and faculty advisors was
that “Ye Dial” would never reach com-

pletion.

Argo Publishes Reviews
Mr. J. B. Laramore, sponsor of The Argo,

replied upon questioning, “No Dial is far
better, in my opinion, than a poor Dial.
The Argo expects to publish from time to

phases of student life; and if these are incor-
porated in the scrapbooks already purchased

Third Place Taken by Argo

The Argo again came through in the
Columbia Press Association Contest and
captured third place. Last year the paper
took fourth place. Over fifteen hun-
dred representatives of scholastic papers
throughout the world were pre

ulations from many publishing houses

He said, “I do not believe it is possible for
“Ye Dial” to materialize this year. Although
in 1931 a large number of men reported
for work on the yearbook, it so happened
that before completion most of the writing
was being done by the editor, Roger Gay.
Personally, I am against a student subscrip-
tion unless the price is made high enough
to permit a better book to be published.
After all, what is a yearbook without fea-
tures?”

MUST WE TALK IT OVER?

The uselessness of gem Ye cia
is so apparent that any further comme!
me The poll conducted by The
Argo bore out the fact that those who
wished a yearbook were quite unwilling to
work for it. Suggestions are excellent, but,
it is quite another task to attempt to put
them into practice. And the men who
thought up these novel ideas had _no prac:
tical plan to begin operation! This in it
self is most ridiculous.

In a former article The Argo set forth
quite clearly its stand upon the whole situa-
tion, Apparently it had no result in con-
vincing the students of the inadvisability of
a Dial. Instead of beating around a bush,
however, The Argo is willing to come right
out and announce that after consultation
of its staff a decision has been reached to
the effect that The Argo will not stand
behind any movement for the promotion of
the Dial. Again we repeat that any further
comment is unnecessary.

EASTER GREETINGS

Today the Easter vacation begins and
the students will go North, East, South and
West towards their homes in various quar-
ters. The Argo hopes that it will be car-
ried back to express to parents and friends
the sincere wishes of the administration
for a Happy Easter. May it be possible
that the vacation will be the means of pro-

Mr. Neilson is an ardent Democrat, a
which he has run for the State Senate. He
also favors modification of the Volstead
act, as he believes it to be doing consider-
Mable harm. Until recently, he was ac-
customed to take a daily bicycle ride, but
within the last three or four years he has
been forced to give that up. However,
he is still fond of outdoor exercise, and

takes a long daily walk. Like the late Mr.
Edison, Mr. Neilson docs not believe that

long hours of sleep are necessary. Mr.
Neilson is not fond of publicity, and it was
not until a few years ago that he permitted
his picture to be printed in any news pub-
lication. On the other hand, he likes people;
bhis house is often the scene of some enter-

With the advent of Spring and the Easter
vacation the traditional turning of young
men’s fancies begins to parallel that of other
years. Nowhere is this meditative lethargy
more apparent than in the study hall,
though it must be said that all classrooms
during the fifth and sixth period afford a
close second. A striking demonstration was
given the other day by a certain one of our
old timers, who, when informed by the in-
structor that he looked bored, betook him-
self, on awakening, slowly and nonchalant-

ly to the blackboard.

Institute Is Incorporated

‘The foundation of the Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology was laid in a “Me-
morial” prepared in 1859 by Prof. Rogers
and presented to the Legislature of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts of 1860.
In April, 1861 an Act was passed by the
General Court of Mass. to incorporate The
Massachusetts Institute of Technology “for

the purpose of instituting and maintaining
a society of arts,

a museum of arts, and a
school of industrial science, and aiding ge
nerally by suitable means the advancement
and practical application of science in con-
nection with arts, agriculture, manufactures
and commerce.” ;

=r Originally located in Boston. the Institute
moved toa " Sharles) River
Basin, This site comprises a tract of nearly
eighty acres extending along the esplanade
on the Cambridge side of the river. Here
are located the educational buildings, the
infirmary, the dormitories and the athletic
field, Many street cars and subways af-
ford easy access from all parts of Boston.

Has Excellent Laboratories

The Institute has one of the leading
scientific and technical libraries of the
United States. It also has numerous large
and well equipped laboratories. The Insti-
tute laboratory work is effectively supple-
mented by visits to engineering and in-
dustrial establishments, and by excursions
directed by members of the faculty.

The estimated cost of one year’s tuition
including board and room is about $1,200.
To assist those students in need of financial
assistance the Undergraduate Employment
Office has a list of available part time posi-
tions open to students.

Student Government Permitted

The student government of the under’
graduates at the Institute is in the hands
of the Institute Committee, a body repre-
senting every important student activity.

The purpose of athletics at the Institute
is not to develop highly trained athletes,
but to encourage all students to participate
in some form of physical recreation.

All students admitted to any subjects
without having fulfilled the usual prepara-
tion requirements are classified as provi-
sional students.

Argo Finds Ideas Vary
On “Ye Dial” Question

(Continued from Page One)
baseball between Prep and some New
Brunswick team might be arranged to raise
money for the publication. Such a contest
would draw many rooters, who would pay
admission,” he said.

Mr Charles H. Brown, Director of Ath-
letics, expressed himself heartily in favor of
“Ye Dial”. “It's the only thing to do, so
that the boys can have a record of their
athletic achievements”, was his remark.

Frank Heur said philosophically, “It’s a
Jong, sad story.” :

Subscription Favored

Carl Schuh, number one man on the ten-
nis team, was more practical. “I'm in favor
of taking up a subscription from students.
The school needs a permanent memento.”

“If the school and students aren't able to
afford “Ye Dial”, why bother to proceed
any further in the matter?” asked Arnold
Jorgenson, president of the Student's Assoc-
iation, in agreement with the stand main-
tained by The Argo staff.

Herbert Fertig became remiscent as he
spoke.” I think that a yearbook is required
for the scholastic records alone, but I have
no idea who will do the writing.”

But, the best answer of the day was given
to this reporter when he interviewed Jimmie
Reilly. The young swimmer refused to com-
mit himself. “I don't know anything about
it,” he confessed.

dropped in. Geraghty, judged another free
throw, making the score 26-18 Jablonsky
slipped a shot in from under the basket
and missed another one from the same spot
a few moments later. The ball went in,
but due to too much curve came out again
Lape sank the last two - pointer for the
Gray Bees. Toward the end of the game,
St. Benedict's began to stall, as is their
usual custom, “Loose” got the ball once and
attempted a shot from beyond mid-court,
but due to his arm, missed getting the
much needed two points, Much as Prep
tried to score in the waning minutes, it was
no use, for the men were tired from the
fast pace that they had been travelling.

Bees Were Outplayed

The game was well played throughout,
but the Prepsters clearly outplayed th
Gray Bees. Despite the fact “Loose”
Jablonsky will beat Lape for All-State ho-
nors, _ If Roy
and if Jablonsky had been in perfect
dition, Prep would have taken St. Benedict's
easily.

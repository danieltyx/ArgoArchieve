PREP ADDS NEW COURSE

This year a new course will appear
in Prep's.schedule of classes. This course
which is called Humanities, is very
similar to that which is offered in mast
colleges.

The class will be taught during con-
ference period with Mr. Dumarae as
chief lecturer. Mr. Moffat and Mrs.
Wilson will also lecture to the class dur-
ing the year.

This course has been added to Prep’s
curriculum in hopes that it will help
students when they take the courses in
college.

 

 

 

David M. Heinlein

 

NEW RULES APPEAR

The new headmaster, Mr. Heinlein,
approved two new restrictions which he
said would be a step forward in im-
proving the standards of the Prep

ool.
The first of the restrictions is that
all boys must wear jackets and ties on
the school premises during the entire
school day period.

The second restriction states that
smoking is prohibited on all grounds
around the school. This rule takes effect
as soon as school opens.

Parties Prepare
Early Campaign

Elections for Student Council offices
will be held in the customary manner
three weeks after the opening of school.
As of now, there are only two parties
which are prepared to run, one party
of which has completed all prepara-
tions in regards to their campaign.

The party which has already organiz-
ed their campaign slate has_ selected
the name of “Prepsters”. Stu Edelberg,
running for president, has selected Clif-
ford Griggs for the vice-presidency,
Clemmie Vitti for secretary, and Joe
Messina for treasurer. The Prepsters’
campaign managers are Dave Hendler
and Carl Baratta.

The opposing party, which has not
yet chosen a name, is led by Stan Bey
who is running for president. Stan
selected Stanley Rosenblum to compete
for the vice-presidency, but this move
still remains tentative.

Shepard

| On August 13th, President Jones
| made the announcement that David M.
| Heinlein will undertake the duties of

Headmaster at the Rutgers Preparatory
School. Tne appointment went into
| effect immediately.

Mr. Heinlein is the successor of Stan-
| ley Shepard, Jr., who resigned from his
post. Before resigning, he had been on
ia year’s leave of absence because of
sdrs. Shepard’s bad health.

Mr. Heinlein has been acting Head-
master since the beginning of the 1953

season. Prior to this, he was head of
the Science department and the As-
sistant Headmaster of the Elementary
| School. “i

He is a very active member of the
Y.M.C.A. and the North Stelton Im-
provement League. Along with these
demanding undertakings he is also a
member of the American Society of
English Education and the Association
of Childhood Education International.

For three years prior to his appoint-
ment, Mr. Heinlein taught at the Voca-
tional and Technical High School in
New Brunswick in the fields of Science
and Math. He will, however, not return
to his old post at that school.

Mr. Heinlein holds a Bachelor of
Science from George Williams College.
After he graduated from there, he spent
four very interesting years in Japan
and the Phillipines teaching children
in private schools. Besides his B. S.
degree in Science from George Williams
College, he also has a Masters degree
in Education from Springfield where
he served as an assistant in Biology.

The other change in the department
was Mr. Holley’s promotion to Associate

Headmaster.

Numerical Grading
Returns to Prep

Rutgers Prep School has adopted a
new marking system which will go into
effect as of September 13. The new
marking system makes use of numerical
grading rather than letters. The letter
system was the chief method of grading
used for many years but gives way to
what Mr. Heinlein says is a_ better
method of marking.

A change in the marking system also
affects the seniors. In order to pass
they must have an average of 65% or
better, but to earn a diploma they must
complete the school year with an aver-
age of 70% or better.

Mr. Heinlein also announced that all
courses will be noticibly stiffened and
that students would find standards
higher acedemically.

Let’s Rock the Old School !

The opening of scnool presents many
problems both to old and new students.
The new students are faced with the
problem of adjustment. To become
acquainted and to feel at home in a
strange school is dififcult.

If one is content to just come to
school, attend classes, and leave for
home as soon as the last bell rings, he
will find himself in the same position
he was in on opening day. Life at Prep
will still appear strange and boring to
these students.

The best way to acquire all the excite-
ment and interest that Prep can offer is
to participate in extra-curricular activ-
ities such activities as the YE DIAL,
our yearbook, and this paper, where
any help will be greatly appreciated.
There is the school play which is one
of the main attractions on the school
calendar. Of course, it goes without
saying, there are four sports at Prep.

If one is not athletically inclined, he
should try to attend every sporting
event. This brings up the age-old
problem of school spirit. Prep should
have one of the best soccer teams this
year in the county, and with good back-
ing, it could have a really great season.

In just two weeks there is a dance
at Prep. Let’s meet everyone at school
there and get into the spirit of things.
Let's rock the old Prep school with
team and school spirit that it has lack-
ed for too long a time.

 

Cheerleading Tryouts Planned

This September brings with it the
forth consecutive year of cheerleading
history at Prep.

Each season a group of girls is chosen
through a series of tryouts. Only three
girls, the captain, Noreen Hudson,
Clemmie Vitti and Nancy Haworth are
returning members from last year's
squad, Uniforms, both for basketball
and soccer, are furnished by the school.
There are a number of openings for
any interested girls.

Tryouts will be held shortly after the
opening of school. All the girls interest-
ed will be taught a few basic cheers.
Immediately after that, the girls will
be given tryouts, and those showing the
best prospects will be selected from the
group by Coach O'Connell.

The Argo

Opens Social Season

An outdoor barbeque and dance will

| be held for the entire school on the

25th of September, two weeks after the
fall term begins.

Mr. Heinlein is in agreement with
the students who believe that an open-
air dance held after the first two weeks
of school should be nothing short of a
huge success. The object of the whole
affair is to enable the students to be-
come better acquainted with one
another.

The dance, “The Prepsters’ Jam-
boree”. will be held in accordance with
the fall season. The dance committee
consisting of Clemmie Vitti, Stu Edel-
berg, Cliff Griggs, Dave Hendler, and
Carl Baratta, is making all the prepara-
tions for the affair.

The highlights of the party will in-
clude a barbeque, games, and record-
dancing. The location selected for the
dance is on the corner of Huntington
and George. next to the Prep Gym.

Special Argo Issued

The Argo’s first edition, unlike pre-
vious publications, is only a two-page
paper. However, the usual four-page
newspaper, which returning Prepsters
are familiar with, will be employed in
all further issues.

The Argo also has changed its print-
er. Last year's printer, the Christie
Press, was released in favor of the
Standard Press. Mr. Mike Hegedus, the
owner, has given Prep an excellent
charge rate on the Argo, the Argomag

 

and other odd printing jobs.

The Argomag is a magazine con-
taining the best works written by the
students during the school year. It is)
published twice a year and will be given)
_ look this year, by the Standard |

Prepster’s Jamboree [PQRT]IGHT

by Cliff Griggs

This being the first edits
school paper for the ‘SS
not possible for
contain any information abou
has happened in spor
fore, the “Sportlight”

  

the

what
as of yet. There.
will try only to
show what may be expected from our
fall sport, soccer.

 

 

Prep will open what we all hope will
be a great year for soccer. Although
it is a new sport at R.P.. soccer is very
popular and the last two teams we have
fielded showed great promise. Last
year’s team consisted mostly of inex-
perienced boys. This year we will have
at least six returning letter winners.

Coach O'Connell stated at the close
of last season that he was very hope-
ful of a good team this year, He has
shown the school how to build a fair
team out of green material. This year,
however, he feels that his team will
show great signs of improvement.

One reason the Coach is so sure of
&@ good soccer team is that certain
valuable players are returning to us
from last year. Two of the greatest as-
sets that the school could have on the
field are Stu Edelberg and Joe Messina.
Stu kicked eight goals for Prep last
lear and made All-State. Joe. while
getting only one goal, showed great
promise at his inside position.

Some of the players returning are
Dave Hendler, a good wing with a heavy
foot, Carl Baratta, another wing, and
also Cliff Griggs, a fair fullback who
should be improved this season. Last
but not least, we must not forget Stan
Rosenblum. Stan made All-State at
Jamesburg but entered Prep too late
last year to help the “Little Scarlet”
out. With such possibilities I will pre-
dict that Prep will have at least a .500
season in soccer.

Ye Dial Editors
Attend C.S.P.A.
For Year Book

On October 15 and 16 five members
of this year's YE DIAL staff had the
Opportunity of going to the Columbia
Scholastic Press Association’s Confer-
ence on yearbooks in New York City.
Those who went were Roger Seamon
and Stan Bey, co-editors; Diane Dorn,

art editor; Clemmie Vitti, copy editor; |
and Barry Brodsky, assistant business |

manager. Mr. Gaggini, the faculty ad-
visor, also attended and provided tran-
sportation for the group with his car.
These students stayed overnight at the
Paris Hotel and attended conferences
and workshops on Friday afternoon and
Saturday morning. On Saturday after-
noon there was a luncheon at the Roo-
sevelt Hotel where the feature speaker
was one of the founders of the new
magazine Sports Illustrated.

In order to take full advantage of
what was offered the group split up
after it arrived so that at least one
person from the school might be at
each meeting. In doing so, these stu-
dents got a taste of all the subjects
discussed at the conference.

Fisher Body Holds Assembly
Keynoting Model Design

On November 15, a representative of
the Fisher Body Craftsman’s Guild
School will present to the school a forty-
five minute program featuring a seven-
teen minute full color motion picture
entitled, “Youth Goes Creative.” Along
with the program goes an opportunity
to win one of eight college scholarships,
each worth from $1,000 to $4,000. The
basic instructions needed to compete in
the Guild’s model car competition will
be given at that time.

Along with the film, a chalk-talk will
be featured which is sure to prove in-
teresting as well as instructive. In this
portion of the program, the student
body will be graphically shown the
basic elements of car design. The rep-
resentative will also display actual
drawings by professional automobile
designers, showing how the automotive
industry works into the future.

Students Plan Trips
For Humanities Class

This year a new course, Humanities,
has been added to the school curricu-
lum. In addition to the regular class-
room course in Humanities, there are
several field trips offered for the pur-
pose of exposing students to culture in
order that they may decide whether
they like the various arts and which of
them they like best.

The first trip taken by the group was
to Princeton, where they attended four
short ballets produced by the “Ballet
Theatre” on October 27th. These
productions in chronological order
were: “Swanlake”, Mam’zelle Anguo”,
then “The Bluebirds” and “Rodeo.”
The first was taken from an old
Russian fairy tale. The second two were
also classic ballets, while the fourth
was a sample of the American ballet.
It was entirely different from the first
three, being a tale of modern times in
the Western part of the United States.

The group is going to New York to
attend an opera, “Faust”, in the spring.
The opera itself was written by Gou-
nod but was taken from a drama by
Goethe.

Another trip the group is planning
is to a concert. The time and place are
not definite, but the group will probably
hear the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
This will probably take place sometime
before the opera.

 

Wolves Wail

On Saturday night, October 30, Prep
held a hayride for the student body.
The plans for the affair were made by
| the Student Council, and a committee
|headed by Cliff Griggs took care of
hiring the wagons used.

The chaperones for the affair were
Mr. and Mrs. Hank Greenberg, Mr.

and Mrs. Jerry Morris and Mr, and
Mrs. Heinlein.

Two trucks were used for the hayride,
one of which was donated by B. & M.
Lumber Company. The other was con-
tracted from Kuberski’s stable. Leo
Kuberski, who owns a stable in South
River, took care of many of the pro-
blems which confronted the hayride
committee. The students, who attended,
met at the gym at 7:00 p.m. Saturday
evening and from there the group was
taken to Kuberski’s stables in cars.
Other students met at Kuberski's at
7:30 where the hayride started.

The two wagons rode through the
wooded area around South River mak-
ing one stop at “Lex’s Barbecue Pit”
where the riders could pick up a small
snack.

On the ride itself, singing with and
without records was most popular.

 

Prep Sees “Barber Of Seville”
At Student Program In Met.

This year another music-loving group
attended one of the operas performed
especially for students. This group,
however, was very small in number
because the bulk of the students will
attend another performance of the
same kind given in April.

Seventeen students and Mr. Dumarae
went into New York by train on
November 10 to see Rossini’s “Barber
of Seville.” The students who attended
last year’s opera will find this one
quite different. It is a much lighter
and altogether gayer opera.

This is Prep’s second year as a mem-
ber of the Opera Guild. Because of
the interested reaction of many stu-
dents, this trip will be an annual affair,

School Plans Trip .. -

Last year a new idea was innovated
at Prep. This new school function was
that of taking a trip to some place of
interest. This was a free trip for which
the Student Council supplied transpor-
tation. The council hired a sufficient
number of buses so that all students of
Prep could go.

Last year’s trip was to the United
Nations and Metropolitan Museum of
Art. This year the date and place of
this trip still remain tentative. The
Student Council, with the consent of
Mr. Heinlein, will decide on the date
of the trip. However, it has been sug-
gested in the Student Council that the
destination of this trip be put to a vote
before the entire student body.

The council will pick three possible
places which might be desirable for
Prep students to visit.

One of the possible places which may
be on this ballot is the Franklin Insti-
tute in Philadelphia. Students who have
suggestions on other possible places to
visit should give them to their council
representatives who will bring these
ideas up at a council meeting. With
your suggestions, this trip might be
your most memorable experience at
Prep.

Dear Editor:

I would like to make a complaint and
give my opinion of the ARGO. I per-
sonally don’t think this paper is amus-
ing enough. You should have some
jocose articles in it. What the ARGO
needs is something to pep it up a
little. Get some real “hep stuff” in
there like a “Kat's Korner,” or some
jokes. You might even throw in a little
bit of Dick Tracy to attract the intel-
lects. I go for a paper that “tickles my
spine” and is not all drab black.

Think it over, Editor. You'll be wise
to let me advise.

Retired Secretary Gets Job
After Leaving Prep’s Employ

For those of you who were here at
Prep several years ago, we have some
news of Mrs. Andrews, who was Prep's
prize financial secretary.
Mrs. Andrews was an efficient and
loyal member of the staff here at Prep
for eighteen years. Besides being a very
competent secretary she served as die-
titian and gave helpful advice on prob-
lems of human nature.
Two years ago Mrs. Andrews left
Prep and retired. Since then, she has
found a job so suitable and comfortable
for herself, that she is working again.
Mrs. Andrews now holds a six month
job, starting November first, as assistant
manager of the Vista Shores Apartment
Hotel, which is a winter resort in Miami
Beach, Florida. She will be a relief
switchboard operator, and her job will
run from five to ten o'clock every
night.

Mrs. Andrews plans to live in one of
the apartments there during the winter.

SPORTLIGHT

by Cliff Griggs

Although the soccer team won only
two games out of seven and tied one,
still we had, in my opinion, a great
team.

First in our lineup comes Stu Edel-
berg. Great job, Stu, on scoring six
goals. Stu now has seventeen goals for
pis three years at Prep. All-State, here
he comes!

Roger Lambertson was new to the
team this year. “Lambie,” at the be-
ginning of the season, did not seem too
much in favor of soccer. However, he
has acquired a favorable opinion of the
game. Great season, kid!

What a man in the goal! Jerry Gor-
ezyca filled the spot easily from the
start. You could tell he was a natural
from the first game. In the game
against Jamesburg, Jerry proved to be
a past master at defending his little
domain.

Now, let’s take a look at Bert Sath-
mary. What a foot that guy has! From
the very first day of practice, every-
body could tell Bert was the kind of guy
that would put a big “Punch” in the
Prepster defense.

Last but not least, Gabe Pitacciato
and Stan Rosenblum get a mention.
Both Gabe and “Stash” did a terrific
job at halfback. Good going, guys!

SOCCER REVIEW

by Howard Tobin

Monday, November Ist, Rutgers Prep
lost its fifth soccer game of the season,
‘n a hard fought battle against a power-
‘ul Jamesburg eleven. This was Prep’s
second loss against the Indians, this
year.

Jamesburg took an early lead on a
tirst period goal, but the “Little Scar-
tet” quickly tied the score with a goal
ay center forward, Stu Edelberg. This
was his sixth of the season.

Indians Score In Fourth

The rest of the first period, and the
complete second and third, saw a score-
less play by both teams. In the fourth
quarter, Jamesburg tallied on a corner
cick. The Indians quickly followed up
with another goal, giving them a three
to one lead. Prep was unable to score
juring the final period.

This was the final game for Rutgers
?rep’s soccer team, and although their
‘ecord of two wins, five losses, and one
tie is not very impressive, credit must
40 to coach O’Connell’s eleven for put-
ting up a good fight all the way.

Prepsters Defeat Wardlaw
For Seasons Second Win

On October 28, the Rutgers Prep
soccer team completed its seventh game
by defeating Wardlaw 2-0. The win
gives the “Little Scarlet” team, to date,
a record of two wins, four losses, and
one tie.

Prep took an early lead on a goal by
Stu Edelberg early in the first period.
The assist can be accredited to Roger
Lambertson. The remainder of the per-
iod was scoreless, but the long boots by
our halfbacks proved a great threat
to Wardlaw team.

Edelberg Scores Again

Edelberg’s second goal on a pass
from Carl Baratta in the second period
increased Prep’s lead to two to nothing.
Although the remainder of the period
went without further goals, there were
many chances for Prep to score.

Three fourths of the way through a
slow third period, with victory seem-
ingly assured, Coach O'Connell sent in
the second string to replace the forward
line. The third and the last period
gave a sneak preview of Prep’s soccer
“stars” of two years from now.

Defense Repells Attack

The team’s defense, Cliff Griggs and
Burt Sathmary, held their own, and
allowed Wardlaw only one chance to
score. Gabe Pitacciato and Stan Ro-
senblum kept pounding at the goal with
long kicks from midfield. In the line,
Stu Edelberg brought his total number
of goals up to five.

At the end of the last quarter the
score stood at two to nothing. For
Prep this was its third shutout in
a row. The two previous were one
against Wardlaw 3-0 and one against
Pingry which ended at a scoreless tie.

ELVES AND FAYS
INVADE THE GYM

On Friday the 29th, a Halloween
party was held for the lower school
students in the Prep school gymnasium.
Prizes were given for the funniest, pret-
tiest, and most original costumes. John
Lipman won the prize for the funniest,
and Petty Drew for the most original.
Earlier in the morning the lower classes
paraded around the school from class
to class in their costumes.

The lower school students received
their report cards on November 2, as
did the upper school. Mr. Heinlein was
well-pleased with the number of stu-
dents who were on the honor roll..

Some of the students of the lower
school will be singing in the lower school
chorus under the direction of Mrs.
Kelly. They will be included in the up-
per school concert given at Christmas.

Mrs. Mildred Ford, art teacher at the
lower school, is instructing an art class
of upper school students this year. Some
of these are interested in mechanical
drawing and others have chosen to
paint and work with ceramics.

On November 4, the elementary
school held a parent-teacher tea for
the purpose of letting parents meet
each other and members of the faculty.
Mrs. Kehoe and Mr. Heinlein received
all the parents. Diane Dorn, Marian
Veale, Estelle Newman, and Noreen
Hudson all helped Mrs. Ward serve
at the tea.

Chemistry Club Makes Plans

To Experiment with Synthetics

A Chem Club has been started this
year by Mr. Daviet. It is open to all
chemistry students and its purpose is
to increase the members’ interest and
knowledge in chemistry.

At the first meeting, the club elected
officers. The president is Roger Lam-
bertson, the vice-president Stan Rosen-
blum, and Bert Sathmary serves as
secretary.

The Chem Club meets every Wednes-
day and performs experiments that are
too difficult and too complex to do in
class. The club is planning to make
things such as synthetic rubber and
dyes. These experiments have practical
application.

Making synthetic fabrics on a labora-
tory scale will be one of the club's high
points. Rayon will be one of the fabrics
which the club will endeavor to make.

The Chem Club is one of the major
clubs in school this year. Last year
there was no organization like it.

‘Headmaster Praises
Honor Roll Students

On Tuesday, November 2, Mr. Hein-
lein announced the honor roll for the
first marking period of the 1954-55
school year. Florence Schmitt led the
the school with an average of 93,
Bruce Gunkel ran a close second with
92. Other students receiving averages
of 90 or better were Roger Lambert-
son, Joe Messina, Carl Stover, Louise
Di Lalo, and Diane Dorn.

The group ranging from 85-89 con-
sisted of Barbara Lipman, followed by
Stu Edelberg, Clemmie Vitti, Pat Rose,
John Bodnar, Matthew Sabino and
Howard Tobin.

Richard Schwartz headed the group
with averages from 80-84 closely fol-
lowed by Mal Cohen, Gail Duschock,
Gabe Pitacciato and Roger Seamon.
Those averaging 81 were Noreen Hud-
son, Arthur Karshmer and William
Romig.

Rolfe Harrison headed the group
obtaining Honorable Mention, an honor
given to students who received a good
average but failed to certify in one
course. The other students were James
Racz, Marian Thompson, Richard At-
kinson, Sharon Ries and Michael Har-
rington.

Mr. Heinlein extended his compli-
ments to those students earning honor
grades. He was pleased with the results
of the first marking period and he
hopes that high standards will be reach-
ed throughout the school year.

 

Parents Of ‘40 Prep Alumnus

Donate Library In His Honor

Something new has been added to
Prep this year. It is a Prep school libra-
ry which is located in room three.
Prep has had a few sets of encyclo-
pedias and a dictionary or two in the
past but never a library.

The funds for furnishing the library
were provided by Dr. and Mrs. Rudolfe,
in memory of their son William Rudol-
fe. William was an expert swimmer and
an honor student here at Prep until
1940 when he graduated. He then went
on to Yale University from which he
graduated in 1944. He had just started
to pave his way to success when he
met his premature death scaling Caule
Glacier.

Louise Di Lalo is librarian, assisted
by Amy Riddering, and any student is
welcome to take books out. The libra-
ry is open till 3 o’clock each afternoon.
A 25c fine per day is charged for over-
due books.

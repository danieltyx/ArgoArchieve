From the
Editor’s Desk

This May edition of the Argo is
the first under its new board of
editors, the staff which will carry
the responsibility throughout the
1959-'60 school year. This incoming
staff will work on the premise
that, as well as being a record of
school functions and activities, the
scholastic newspaper is a means of
presenting certain students with op-
portunities to increase and augment
writing skills, with various and often
diversified assignments. As well, it
permits its editors to practice or-
ganizational and operational skills.

The editor-in-chief of this year's
staff, Linda Levy, is much to be
complimented on her fine work
along this line. Under her leader-
ship, the Argo expanded from the
3-column publication of previous
years, and with this expansion
came numerous opportunities for the
betterment of the paper, many of
which she took advantage of. This
editor hopes that he can continue
in this new tradition.

Prepsters Discuss ‘Going Steady;
Majority Votes Against Practice

Senior Acceptances

Considering all the various and
different schools at which the sen-
iors have been accepted, it looks
as if that class is really going places.
Mary Bunting will be spending four,
cold years up in the University of
Vermont while Linda Levy will study
either at Russell Sage or Douglass.
If she goes to Douglass, she might
find two other classmates: Amy
Riddering and Joke Rooda. Harvard
will have the pleasure of Danny
Struk, and Jay Goldsmith — will
either study at Rutgers or Lafayette.
Arthur Feldman will probably spend
some nice, sunny days at the Uni-
versity of Florida. Bob Shepard is
going to the Maine School of For-
estry, ‘way up by the timber line,
and Tom Chester has been accepted
by Clemson. Bob Eber, Steve Hol-
sten, Arnie Goldberg, and Miles
Merwin have been accepted at
Rutgers, and so might be nearby.

and footloose. This supposed status brings about the debate of whether

dance by no means disproves her observations. The sociability of exchang-

stag line, the art of conversation, all
have been misplaced by the vogue
of going steady.

MISS WARR TO LEAD EUROPEAN TOUR

by Peter Wilson
Miss Warr, who has taught English and occasionally biology for two
years at our school, is leaving — only temporarily, it is hoped.
After a summer in Europe, she plans to remain to study at the

University of Stockholm for a year. Miss Warr has, for the past two
year’s, been leading summertime groups of the Hostel Association, one
in America and one in Europe. This year, she will lead another in Europe,
featuring the Scandinavian countries.

This year the examination sched-
ule has been revised so that the
taking of the exams will cover a
six-day period beginning Tuesday,
June 2 and extending over the
week-end to June 9. The reason
for the revision is to assure that
each student will have, at maximum,
only two exams one one day.

Having recently become fascinated
with the Scandinavian countries,
Miss Warr applied for this particu-
lar tour, It includes England and
Scotland, as well as Denmark,
Sweden, and Norway. She has not
met her group yet, but, as she says,
“I’ve always been lucky enough to
have interesting people.”

 

 

PRESS NEWS

 

CSP A: Its Aims

Throughout the year, much question has arisen concerning the Co-
lumbia Scholastic Press Association. Just what does that little seal adja-
cent to the Argo’s masthead signify? What does it stand for?

Basically, the C.S.P.A, is an organization dedicated to the betterment
of scholastic publications, such as the Argo. One of the Association's
means of effecting improvement js its annual contest, in which all edi-
tions of each newspaper entered are carefully read over and viewed
objectively, in regard to writing, layout design, editing, feature work,
headlining, and so forth. The judges’ criticisms of each publication are
explained and reported to that paper's staff, along with an evaluation
of its work in the form of an award for either a first, second, third, or
fourth-class publication, This year, the Argo holds a second-place rating,
due largely to some helpful criticisms from the previous year,

 

 

Annual Meetings in N, Y.

The highlight of the C.S.P.A,’s yearly activity is its annual three-
day conference, held at Columbia University during the second or third
week of March, Thousands of delegates from schools all over the United
States attend the various meetings, which range from formal lectures
delivered by professional journalists, to round-the-table discussions pre-
sided over by the high-school editors themselves, or by thelr advisors,
This editor, being a veteran of two such gatherings, can say with convic-

tion that the programs are usually quite interesting and always extremely
informative.

After she leaves these people, she
will accompany a group of hostel
leaders in a twelve-day trip through
Russia and Finland. She expects
that, because of its briefness, it
will be less instructive than the
hosteling trip, but it will be “the
most interesting.”

She has always had an interest
in the rugged people of the North,
and feels that studying at Stock-

holm will greatly increase that
interest.
Skiing, bicycling up and down

mountains, and exploring old castles
and fiords will not be an anti-
climax to her past interesting ex-
periences. She is  disdainful of
“touristy” occupations and feels
that she has always been able to
find out what the real people of a
country are,

dances which he plans, Often he
gets a sudden “brainstorm” which
results in a unique and interesting
social affair, As witness to this fact,
one has only to think of last
spring's “Hawaiian Sunset” dance or

the falling leaves at the “Autumn
Leaves” dance.
The final reward and crowning

achievement of Bruce's life at Prep
is his election as Student Council
President. The school has committed
its affairs and problems into his
capable and experienced hands. The
honor comes as a well-earned vote
of confidence from his many friends.

_
the youths came home with smiles
on their faces and a true feeling
that a good time was had by all.

Students Questioned

Questioning some of the “gang”
about going steady brought such
apathetic remarks as: “It’s okay if
that’s the sort of thing you like.”;
“It’s okay if you have trouble get-
ting other dates.”; “Sure, if he's
got a car.”; “Ad nauseum!”

Going steady has made us un-
steady. At our “tender” ages, we
are still dependent on our parents.
Why do we go out of our way to
make ourselves dependent on one
date? Why can we not “go steady?”
We need a steady stream of com-
panionable friends. Holding hands
with one boy might very easily
develop into a vice which might
become very difficult to loosen.
There is a time for all things and
going steady should be delayed until
we reach maturity.

Cooperstown

by Richard Patt

Have you ever wondered what Ty
Cobb's spikes looked like, or what
the first uniforms were like, or how
heavy Babe Ruth’s bat was? All of
these treasures, and many more,
can be found at Cooperstown, a
small town in central New York,
about four hours from New Bruns-
wick. It is here that baseball orig-
inated in 1839 when Abner Double-
day drew up the first rules and laid
out the first field. This field still
remains and is maintained by the
town's citizens with help from the
major leagues as a memorial to
Doubleday. The Hall of Fame Game
is played there each year between
teams representing the American
and National Leagues.

Located there also is the National
Baseball Hall of Fame. Probably
the town's greatest attraction, it is
visited annually by over 100,000
fans. In this museum are plaques
of all Hall of Fame members and
mementoes of the greatest players
of all times, including Lou Gehrig,
Rogers Hornsby, and Walter John-
son. On its four floors baseball
trophies, uniforms, paintings, and
Statues are displayed.

Whether or not you are an avid
baseball fan, I think you would
find a trip to Cooperstown interest-
ing and worthwhile.

STUDENT COUNCIL REPORT

by Bardy Levavy

Extremely little business

has transpired

in the most recent

sessions of the Student Council. The school year is rapidly drawing
to a close, and most arrangements for last-minute affairs had been

made in previous months.

The Council has, however, taken care of field day preparations,
alloted a sum of money in “perpetuum” to buy a basketball trophy,
and finished up all work in regard to the magazine drive.

In the drive, which took place in late February and early
March, $1500 was collected. This is the school’s commission on

the total subscription money, and amounts to more than 33%

of

the whole sales revenue. It has been turned over to the school's

Board of Trustees, where it will

probably be used for the hiring

of an architect to make prospective drawings for the new gym.
However, the $1500 figure is not official as yet, for at this writing,
the auditors are still going over the books. The drive for the new
gym will be officially launched next fall.

The Council also was instrumental in the arrangements for the
highly successful Senior Day, May 7. The class assignments, which
worked so remarkably well, were directed by Mary Bunting

Thanks to A.Z, Holley’s capable
cookery and Art Feldman, refresh-
ment manager, lunch, too, was a big
success. Tuna fish, hot dogs, and
ege salad were available to all, and
plenty of drinks were on hand.

IN THIS
CORNER

by Paul Gottlieb

Baseball is a game which requires
great skill and accuracy. An able
player must have a good arm, a
sure eye, and a fast and agile body.
His judgement must be good, for
he may have several options
in fielding, batting, and base-run-
ning. It is these facets of the game
which draw crowds to major league
ball parks throughout the summer.

Upon questioning members of
the student body, I have found
that many do not know the origins
of baseball. Perhaps at this time,
it might be wise to give an account
of the game’s beginnings, and there-
by bring more fans into the light
of baseball.

Abner Doubleday is said to have
been the founder of the game. He
drew up the playing rules, and laid
out the first real playing field at
Cooperstown, N.Y. in 1839. Games
resembling baseball were played in
the United States before that year,
but Doubleday is accredited with
founding the game as we know it
today. In honor of the game's orig-
inator, The National Baseball Mu-
seum, including baseball’s Hall of
Fame, is located in Cooperstown.

The popularity of the game spread
very rapidly. Coll high school
clubs, and community organizations
started teams. Through these or-
ganizations, many professional base-
ball players have made their start.

Misfortune has pursued Prep’s
1959 baseball team for its whole
season. Errors in early innings

have cost “The Little Scarlet” runs
which they were unable to win
back. The loss of Bob Eber, capable
catcher, has also been a hard blow
to the Prep Nine (through an
injured thumb).

However, the season has a lighter
side. Dave Weiss, long-legged and
lanky first baseman, is gaining ex-
perience and polish. Jack McCor-
mick and Richard Stess have seen
action at catcher and shortshop
respectively, and they too are gain-
ing valuable experience much needed
by a participant in any sport.

SEASON'S FINISH

May, 1959

Dunn Singles To Break Up Wiskowski’s No-Hitter
As South River Rides To 6-0 Triumph Over Prep

Tuesday, May 19:

Today South River High School
swatted 12 hits, collected 6 runs, and
copped their eighth victory, win-
ning 6-0. Jim Wiskowski, South
River's pitcher, allowed but one
safety, a solid single to Jim Dunn
during the 6th frame. Only this
hit and a walk to Jim Racz in the
same inning thwarted pitcher Wis-
kowski’s bid for a perfect game.

S. R. Scores in First

South River drew first blood as
the game opened, coupling an error
and a triple for the run. After
Rutgers Prep was easily retired in
the bottom of the Ist, both teams
failed to score in the 2nd inning.
South River next increased its lead
to 2-0 in the 3rd frame when, after
a walk, they clouted a double and
a single in succession. Bruce Gunkle
then replaced Ted Browne as pitcher
for Prep and quelled the threat.
Prep failed to get the ball out of
the infield in the 3rd.

South River Gets 4

Afler a scoreless 4th inning, South
River pelted Gunkle for 4 runs, 2
coming in the 5th and another 2
in the 6th. A flurry of 7 hits over
these frames provided South River
with the runs. Neither team scored
in the "nal inning.

Hauptman Speaks At Annual Baskethall Banquet

This year’s basketball banquet was held on April 9th at the Log Cabin
Inn. The banguet’s program included two guest speakers, a recapping of
the season by Coach Dickinson, and the presentation of the basketball

letters and trophies.

The guest speakers were Mr. Norman Van Arlsdalen, considered one

of the top officials in the state, and
nouncer for WCTC. Both of these

Mr. Harvey Hauptman, a sports an-
men made interesting speeches on

the “behind-the-scenes” part of basketball.

Letters were awarded to 10 varsity players and 8 J.V. boys.

AS ex-

pected, Bruce Gunkle was the big “trophy man,” winning the nod as
the team’s most-valuable-player and best foul-shooter, as well as receiving
a trophy from the Perth Amboy Evening News for being chosen the
county’s top player. Jim Dunn received the most-improved-player trophy,
and Irv Quackenboss received the best sportsmanship trophy.

Pitcher Browne was in trouble in
each of the first three innings, but
escaped, letting only two men score
while stranding a total of 6. A
brilliant catch in left field by Bruce
Gunkle, in a last-ditch stab to save
a hard-hit line drive from going

through for extra bases, got Browne

Prep’s Little Scarlet Bows

This was Prep’s last game of the
year. The team closed out a very
unsuccessful season with 14 losses:
but certain individuals showed up
brightly. Steve Holsten clouted a
total of 12 hits, four for extra
bases, to wind up with a .307 aver-
age. Pete Wintersteiner manged 8
for 24, and a .333 mark.

ACTION PACKS MARCH

Lacrosse, an old Indian game, was
introduced to Prep last March when
boys in the 6th, 7th, and 8th grades
began learning its fundamentals
from Coach Al Twitchell of Rutgers
and some of his players. The ses-
sion, which lasted for a month,
opened with a clinic behind the
Rutgers Gym. It is hoped that by
next year the boys will have a
full-time coach and a J.V. team.

Basketball Contest
Also during March, a basketball

To Highland Park Owls, 13-4

Highland Park High School provided the opposition as Prep went
after its first victory of the season last Monday, May 18. The result was
a 13-4 victory for the Parkites. The game, played under a clear sky at
the winners’ field in Donaldson Park, was fairly close until the sixth
inning, at which point the score read 7-4. At that time, however, the toll
of pitching hard under a blazing sun showed its effects on Bruce Gunkle
and the home team made off with 6 runs to wrap up the decision.

Swimmers Compete

Mr. O'Connell instituted a swim-
ming program this winter, open to
all students. The program was de-
signed to improve swimming and
also for the enjoyment of the stu-
dents.

The girls weekly “splash-day” is
Tuesday. During the course of the
winter, Mr. O'Connell has been in-

structing them. On March 17th
there was a meet in the YMCA.
pool. Polly Schneider and Nancy
Tomkinson turned out to be the
outstanding swimmers.

The boys’ day is Friday, They

have been helped by Mr. O'Connell
and Mr, Otto Hill of Rutgers. On
March 20th the boys had their
swimming meet. Warren Marshall,
Jack McCormick, Jim Smith and
Jim Racz were winners) Some of
the better swimmers have been
working out at the Rutgers pool
as well,

The top of the batting order ac-
counted for Prep’s four runs, two
each coming in the 3rd and 5th
innings off of the servings of Park’s
moundsman, Mark Stett. In each
of these innings, lead-off man Ted
Browne came all the way around
for a score. Both of Steve Holsten’s
hits were integral parts of the
rallies. He knocked in 2 runs. One
of Pete Wintersteiner’s two base
hits accounted for yet another,
while the fourth scored on an error

Long Hits

The sixth-inning Highland Park
uprising was capped by two triples.
One was a long blow to the opposite
field which took the Prep defenses
completely by surprise

Another factor which hurt the
Prepsters in this inning was a
number of errors. The quick and
daring baserunners of the home
team kept catchers Ted Browne
and Bob Eber on their toes through-
out the game. This was only Eber’s
second appearance since returning
from a three-week absence necessi-
tated by a broken thumb.

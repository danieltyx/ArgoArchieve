Educate yourself so that you may

I have always been impressed by
the persistence men have had as they
overcame the many obstacles which
rose between them and their con-
tribution to human experience and
knowledge. Only extreme and repeti-
tive penetration into knowledge will
enable you acquire the fundamentals
upon which you may build your
future thoughts.

Meet the Many Challenges

New knowledge seems most often
to arise from challenges to one’s ac-
cepted way of living. Wherever
peoples of different religions, na-
tions, races, and experience have
met, they have wrought new know-
ledge out of their reciprocal ques-
tioning of facts, beliefs, and values.

You must question and continually
reassess yourself as you study, As a
citizen of a great metropolitan area
you should take every advantage to
know other peoples. Your language
studies (including English) are con-
stantly telling you about people.
Seek to master the finer and deeper
meanings.

Find Wider Understanding

I welcome you all to our 194th
school year. You have fine minds:
develop them. You are strong,
healthy, and capable of great moti-
vation: work hard. You are on the
fringe of a polyglot culture: seek
the human understanding therein.

Senior Compliments

Student Attitudes *** °

Dear Editor,

As a student of three years stand-
ing at Prep, I can truly say that the
decorum, behavior, and general at-
titude of the student body has stead-
ily improved each year. AS a re-
sult, the faculty~has, in-eachsuc-
cessive year, placed more and more
confidence in the Prepsters as a
group, and in each person as an in-
dividual.

This gradual change in the re-
lationship between the faculty and
the student body has been brought
about by a new maturity evidenced
in each successive entering cla‘s.
Evolutionary processes catch up with
freshmen in their first days at Prep,
during which they learn that they
are respected as individuals, and
have a definite standard of conduct
to live up to. Without forsaking the
fun and minor pranks which are
essential to the new student, our
recent classes have turned their
energies more towards useful ends
than toward vandalism,

Another favorable metamorphosis
has been the slow and painstaking
change from a school of pupils to a
school of students. Let me define
the terms, pupil and student. A
pupil occupies desk space physically
and at the end of the day he rushes
out to purge his soul of academic
content. The student occupies about
the same space, but uses mental
prowess also. In recent years, Prep
students have completely merited
all the confidence placed in them, I
am sure that this year will mark
even more maturity and greater
school participation on the part of
Prep.

Respectfully,
A Senior.

The Queens Day Camp, under the

Rutgers Prep is fortunate to have
two new teachers this year. Mr.
Michael L. Lasser will be teaching

sophomore and junior English. In
the lower school, math and science
will be taught by Mr. Sorrel Paskin.

Mr. Lasser, a resident of New

 

Brunswick, was an undergraduate
student at Dartmouth. He received
his M.A. at Brooklyn College and is
doing graduate work towards his
Ph.D. at Rutgers. He has taught

overnight excursions, including trips
to Jenny Jump and Stokes State
Forest. The campers also took many
day trips to such places as Fort
Dix and Paulingskill Lake. They
even visited the Soviet Exhibition in
New York.

Summer School Ends Third Year

The summer school also chalked
up a successful season, Many stu-
dents from all over this area at-
tended. The day was broken up into
two periods of two hours each, The
first period ran from 8:30 to 10:30,
and the second, from 10:30 to 12:35.
Two new teachers, Mr. Lasser and
Mr. Paskin, who taught in the sum-
mer school, are back on the faculty
for the regular season.

Besides enabling many students
to make up courses that they had
missed during the regular school
year, it gave many students the op-
portunity to do advanced work.

All in all, Prep's summer activities
proved extremely successful. The
camps enabled many boys to have a
good time while getting training in
many fields. The summer school,
while not as enjoyable as the camps,
did a great deal to improve the minds
of many students.

hope, a pleasant one.

Spring Monopolizes
Social Activities

At the present time, this editor finds it in order to

er a sugges

Uon to Student Council President Bruce Miller, and to the other
ollicers, concerning the schedule of council-sponsored a ies in the
coming year. In the past, in spring, there has always been a great rush
of special events, which are lacking throughout st of the st of

the year,

Unless a change is made, it is likely that once again the Field Day,
the Senior Day, the annual class trips, the play, the Junior-Senior
Prom, and another Spring dance will be crowded together into a rela
tively short period of time. Then, there are baseball ganies, as well as the
team’s practices, all of which consume a great deal of time. Oltcn it
is those last few weeks of classes that many of the faculty members
choose for term-paper deadlines. There is the annual election of the
next year’s council officers, as well as the final edition of the Argo,
which must follow immediately

As past events have proved, often the people who must plan all
these affairs cannot give as much time as is necessary. The suggestion
is that the spring schedule be lightened slightly by transferring one
or two special activities to a relatively “dead” month, such as November
or February.

 

ARGO SEEKS ASSISTANCE

As usual at this time of year, the Argo is seeking skilled writers
to handle its numerous and varied assignments. Any student who has
sufficient interest, time, and ability is welcome. I must stress, however,
the necessity of full cooperation between writers and editors. Articles
must be of the exact assigned length, and they must be finished by a
certain deadline, They must be well-written stories, carefully re-read
for errors; it is preferred, although not necessary, that they be typed.

 

LIBRARY (continued from page 1)

of times the library will be open. Students will get written permission as
usual from study hall teachers to use the library references and to get
books for reviewing. The library is not a study room or student lounge and
should be used only as specified by the librarian in charge.

Increasing the number of volumes in the library is, of course, dif-
ficult because of limited space, In spite of this, librarians will appreciate
any suggestions from the students for new purchases and will add as
many as possible this year.

tration’s serious attitude toward
humanities. He feels that Rutgers
Prep stresses the value and import-
ance of humanities much more than
any high school, and this is one of
the reasons why he likes Rutgers.

Mr. Lasser is married but has no
children. His home is at 172 Philips
Road. He is a classical music lover
as well as being and ardent fan of
jazz and folk music.

Philosophy Major Teaches Eighth

Mr. Sorrel Paskin will teach 8th
grade science and math. He taught
math and chemistry this summer at
Prep. Mr. Paskin has a degree in
philosophy from the University of
Pennsylvania and is doing his grad-
uate work in that subject at Coluin-
bia. He has just married and is now
living on Alexander St., in New
Brunswick.

We certainly hope both Mr. Lasser
and Mr. Paskin will enjoy teaching
at Rutgers. With the help of the
faculty and the students, they will
easily fit into the friendly and stu-
dious atmosphere of our school.

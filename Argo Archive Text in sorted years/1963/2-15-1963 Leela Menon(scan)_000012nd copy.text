‘OBBY

William Dunlap, a member of the Class of '66, has a hobby

that is unique in this echool,

Ye memorizes both long and short

poems which he recites and acts out,
Ye started this unusual hobby at Carson Long lilitary School,
near ‘Jarrisburg, Pennsylvania, which he attended during the sixth,

seventh, and eighth grades.

Tne school held mid-year and commence-

ment declamation contests, which-any student could enter to recite

poetry or make speeches,

There were first, second, and third place prizes which con-

sisted of money, varsity letters, and medels.
seventh grade, Dunlap entered the contest.

When he wes in the
He was coached by a

senior Enflish teacher, and finished in third place with his ren-

dition of "Casey At the Bat."

In the eighth grade Dunlap entered both contests, reciting

"The Cremation of Sam NeGee" for the first and "Dunkirk" at the

second,

. Tor the former he received a second place prize.

The largest. group he has recited for was 900 people, but on

occasion Dunlap admits he will recite for one person.
toire also includes "The Shooting of Dan i cGrew," parts of

dis repe-
"Congo"

and "Paul Revere's Ride," "Tie Road Not Taken," "The Tide Rfses,
+ne Tide Talls,' various Indian poems, "Paradox," "Going After Cows

jn a Tor," and "The Poor Unfortunate Hottentot."

Ye is now learning

io recite "Tne Raven," and his goal is to learn "Evangeline."

 

VARSITY: DROPS CLOSE.

. Conquered by a rally late’
in the-second helf, tue Prep
Casers dropped one notch below
an “even season," "ednesday,
when they lost a 75-69 deci-
sion to *outh Brunswick high
sehool, at the Prem Gym.

The.play was even. through-
out the first period, but the
Argonauts moved out to a six
point lead in the second quar-
ter, Their lead was then cut
to: two points, with the half-
time score at 42-40.

ign scorers for the Prep
team were Jacobs with 22 points,
voung with 18, and Turtletaub
with 16.

LETTER Cont.
<hich they could have avoided,
[4 this organization had been
ioensd for such a beneficial pur-
pose, let the students themselves
all the students--back it up
end not vote to spend the money
in otier ways.

It is not a discredit to
the seniors to have voted down
ihis measure, There is no ques-
tion that an exchange student
would be beneficial to the school,
but not all the students openly
support this program and have
proved themsdlves worthy of an
excHange student, Until they do,
we will save our money for a
suitable and useful class gift.

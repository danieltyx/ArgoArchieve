TEACHER DISAGREES WIT? SENIOR
STATES OFINION ON EXCANGE

To. the Editor:

DECISION;
STUDENT ISSUE

In reference to the letter submitted to The Weekly Arzo, I
wish to discuss the problem of the exchange student froma for-

eisner's point of view.

It apperrs to me that the Seniors, ex-

Cusablv inexperienced in a matter like this, are disputing irrel-
evant points, while overlooking real difficulties.
Tietr "most common arzument" pertains to the suitability of

our scnool as a host for a foreicn student,

I believe that the

American Tield Service is competent to decide this cuestion for

us,

The concern about the reactions of an exchange student to a

private school is humane but superfluous,

eager to experience American
life, and they are particularly
interested in the activities of
their 4nerican peers, The con-
cepts "private and public
schools" do not mean much to
tiem, because they are not aware
of the great difference between
the two. To them they are Amer-
ican schools,
as we now it, with its exten-
sive extracurricular program
Jses not exist elsewhere, "A-
-.oad" the emphasis is on the
»demic work, as it is in Prep.
Yivate schools may very
well make the better impression
on them, ‘We do:not have a sug-
arcoated, whippedcream exchange
program, but we have an academic
vrogram which compares favorably
with those abraod. There are
misconceptions abovt Americen
education, unfavoreble for us.
We do not want to feed these.
There are no indicétions
that Prep will be in an awkward
transition period next year,
the preparations for the move
.a.v@ been profound, The student
comins here to share American
life will have to accept this
transition as a facet of our
life. What absurd individual
would anticipate having an
“easy time" in America? This
-fval is a sign of decadence,
‘Le foreign student behongs to
She selected few and therefore

a-os rations,
“ne difficulties which
‘obs out of our one previous
Capearisnce were of a personal
iuss, If anyone expected
XL Sersonal satisfaction,

-n vce disappointment was
deserved, because his motiva-
itons should not have been of a
virsonal nature but should nave
bean vert of a hicher plan,

The Juniors, more than the

 

  

 

 

Toreign students are

 

The public school,

 

Seniors, should be most concerned
with this problem. The Seniors
will be dispersed, while the
Juniors will ‘ave the job of
making the student feel at home,
But we should expect the Seniors
to set an example.

We snould focus our atten-=
tion on the following questions:
Is: this cause worthwhile? ‘Would
it contribute to tne creation
of better rehations between na-
tions? Would it be of any na-
tional value in the sense of
correcting certain misconcep-
tions about America? Would it
be of any value to our sciiool?
Are we prepared to sacrifice,
financially and otherwise? Are
we willing to let the foreign
cuest. snare our private lives?

CALLS WILLIANS' PLAY
WORTIVWELLE BUT SLOW

by Ralph Rosenberg '64

. Tm ig Doesn't

Stop Ler » ls Tennessee
Villiars” play. It cone
cerns 2. former socizlite's pit-
iful attempt to convince herself
that she isn't coing to die
soon, Willieas tries to show
that death without a shred of
nobility of disnity can also

be- tragic. .

The central character is
Flora Goforth, played by “er-
moine. Baddeley, who made her
Dreadwey debub in A Teste of
Honey, She is finishing her
menoires, the dook of her life,
because she realizes that "this
suumer:sie will die." A wan-
cering poet, Chris, whom some
revievers have labeled.a Christ
symbol, comes to Flora's villa
to comfort her during this, her
last summer, But Flora misun-
derstands his offer and tries
to sedude him, At the end of
the play, when Tlora is near
death and is crying out for
God, it is too late,

~ The major flaw in The iilk
Train 1s that it doesn't seem
to be going anywhere. Tlora is
a pathetic amusing clown but not
a tragic heroine, The play is
nevertheless worthwhile enter-
talnment,

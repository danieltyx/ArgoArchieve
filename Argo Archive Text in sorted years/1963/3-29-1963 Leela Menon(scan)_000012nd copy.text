CALLS IT

‘OVERPOWERING AND ABSORBING

by Stephenie Matusz
“to Kill a Mockingbird”is an absorbing and overpowering tale
of society in a small southern town, seen through the eyes of a
amall, perceptive girl. Scout and her brother, Jem, have never
known fear until they find their family in the midst of a racial

erisis.

There is growing suspense and overwhelming fear in the story
which are intensified through the excellent photography. Am inter-
esting plot, combined with excellent acting, makes the mivie of-

fective and appealing.

platform concerning a éiscugs-
ion of the guidance program at
the forum on April 6. Mem-
bers have made suggeations that
the school hire a guidance coua-
selor or have two or three face
ulty members take the specific
responsibility to help juriors
and deniors with colleges.
Concerning the present
guidence system, it was sug~-
gested that there be more in-
tereat on the part of each stu-
dent and teacher, and that per-
haps the faculty members should
have specific meetings with
their advisees.

 

MR. KARKOFF, JV COACH,
IS SENIOR AT RUTGERS

Mr. Kenneth Karkeff, a sen-
ior at Rutgers University, is
the mew Junior Varsity baseball
coach at Rutgers Prep.

Mr. Karkeff is studying to
be a teacher of Physical Educat-
doa and Science. He plans to
teach and coach next year at the
Preparatory Scheol.He also plays
college baseball and does umpir~

Bo

Although the team has a pro-
blem because of the lack of a
good catcher and pitcher, Mr.Kar-
koff says that he looks foward
to a fairly good season. He feels
that the team members are hard
workers and are really trying
bard. The infield seema very
strong, and the hitting is rea-
sonably good. He is con@ident
that the JV team will be able ta
hold its own.

VARSITY SQUAD DROPS
SCRIMMAGE TO LINDEN

The Rutgers Prep Varsity
baseball team dropped 7-0 srin-
mage to Liadex high school on
March 23. The aim was to see
where improvement was meeded with-
im the team as well as to have
everyone play in good compstit~-
ion.

The scrimmage lasted 11
innings, in which everyone on
the Prep team played at least
three innings.

Throughout the game Prep's
defensive play was good but the
weakmness lay in the hitting,
where the batters struck out 19
times in the 11 inning spar.
Mr. Riesener believes that if
strikeouts cam be cut down con-
siderably, the Prep team will
have a fin season.

Although the score of the
game was 7-0, the game was much
closer than it seems.Lindenhad
only a few more hits than Prep
while the Prep hitters left many
men strauded on base.

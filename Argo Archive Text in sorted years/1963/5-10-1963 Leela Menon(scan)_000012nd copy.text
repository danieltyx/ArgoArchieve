’ To the Editors:

To play Lacrosse, one has to be able to throw and catch a
lacrosse ball, run, dodge, and suffer innumerable injuries from
one well-known defense mane To watch Lacrosse, all one has to do
is sit and occasionally groan. Yet, the Lacrosse team out numbers
the spectators at least two and one-half to one (counting teach-
ers).

One of the reasons why there are not many spectators is that
the Lacrosse team never with.» Who wants to sit in the sun for an
hour and watch a team lose while he could go to a baseball game
whare he can sit in the shade, chase girls, listen to the radio
or even watch the tean wine

The Lacrosse team cannot promise a winning season or even
a victory this year but it will have a winning season next yearo
So for a few grunts from the defense and a few spectacular plays

by the offense come on out to the Lacrosse gameso

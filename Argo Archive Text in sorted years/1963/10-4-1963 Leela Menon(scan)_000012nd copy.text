JAMESBURG'S VICTORY
IN FEAT WITH FREP

Rutgera Preparatory School
was handed its first loss in
two outinge by Jamesburg this
pest Friday on the Prep Soccer
field. Both of these teams were
evenly watched in ability, but
Jamesburg got two lucky breaks
and scored twice. Prep was une
able to score even though it
waa infront of the Jamesburg
goal for much of the gamee

As in Soccerama, Prep's
game was good defensively. Out-
standing in their defensiva
Slay were Mike Gottlieb and Ed
vere Mike Jacobs and Ken
afchik played their usual
3 ganes Bob Yacknowita led
the fullbecks in their defene
ve play by spoiling several
» goals for Jamesburg. This
gave FPrep's front a chance to
ecore, but they were unable
to do anything offensively.
This, however will not be con-
sidered as Trep's usual game
because 1t is made up of a
greatly improved team.

The new addition on the
team, ©d Gorchinski, is a wing
on the foward line. Soccer is
a new game for him, but already
he shows speed and ability.

This week the Prep Soccer

ia on the road for two
gones against Liorristown on
Vednesday, and Unglewood on
Friday»

RUTGERS PREPARATORY SCHOOL

Volume LXII
DANCE HELD —

On March 8, 1952, the long-de-
layed informal record Antiee was
attended by a slight minority of
the school, thirteen couples to be
precise. Your reporter would like
to list here the names of the
thirteen couples present.

Harold Williamson and Trudy
Webber, Lenny Bartlett with Ginny
Reigger, Jim Weisfeld and Joyce
Kenneally, Jim Lamont and Resebud
Lefebvre, Alan Black and Clem
entina Vitti, Jim Rothschild and
Elaine Shevin, Gary Armstrong and
Jean Devine, Clark White and Joyce
Tuckey, George Van Vechten and
Connie Peders, Bill Cramer and
Ruth Soeter, Norb Selesky and Car-
men Watson, Dick Moore and Virgin-
ia Ann Hudson, John Kuhlthau and
Dereen Reinhart enjoyed the dance
immensely. Straty Nicholas, John
Baer, Jack Tayler, Richard Lock-
hart, Ted Nestler, and Dan McCor-
mick stepped in te take part in
the festivities.

A great deal of credit must go
to Harold Williamson, Robert Lock-

hart, and others who set up the
beautiful decorations for the
affair. Crepe streamers strung

from the baskets to the beams and
a wagon wheel, hanging from the
ceiling on cleverly-concealed
wires, added to the cheerfulness
of the scene. George Van Bechten's
amplifier system was invaluable as
the records boomed loudly over the
speeker. Mr. and Mrs. Shepard were
chaperones, and soda was served
with the assistance of Jebnny

Williams.

ARGO JOINS CO

LUMBIA PRESS
ASSOCIATION

In reply to a letter which Jim
Lamont sent to the Columbia Scho-
lastic Press Association, that or-
ganization recently sent us entry
blanks and informational folders.
Our editor immediately submitted
two copies of each issue of THE
ARGO for this year and also two
copies of THE ARGOMAG, These news—
papers and magazines will be enter-
ed in competition with those of o-
ther schools for the best publica-
tion in its own field.

The annual convention of the
Association, which a few selected
members of the staff will attend,
will be held this year on Narch
13, Uj, and 15 in New York City.
Editor Lamont will undoubtedly at-
tend, but the romaining represen-
tatives have not, at the time this
issue af THE ARGO goes to press,
been chosen. Several underclassmen
are being considered, because next
year they will have to manage the
publications.

In submitting the publications,
certain rules had to be followed.
The entries had to have been writ-

ten and set up entirely by the
students arid strictly observed
deadlines had to be met, TIE ARGO

and THE ARGOMAG having to be sub-
mitted by January 10 and February
1 respectively. A fee of six dol-
lars was required for the magazine,
six dollars for the newspaper, and

According to the popular defi-
nition, an editorial is an article
expressing the opinions of the pa-

r in which it appears on any one
of the millions of events and oc-
eurrences in which the paper deals.
The editorial can deal with just
one of these or can go in for
wholesale discussions. Because of
the long period of time which has
elapsed since the last ARGO and
because of the myriad happenings
in Prep latély,this editorial will
be a sort of pot-peurri of criti-
cism, applause, and general wan-
dering about in the world of R.P.S.

The main concern of all members
of the publication staffs at pre-
sent is the” distressing lack of
ads for YE DIAL, Actually he sit~

The student council held one
meeting during the last month, At
this meeting Pat McGovern made a
motion that the flag be saluted on
the day of chapel exercises, A
vote was taken.and passed unanim-
ously. The matter will now be
taken up with Mr.Shepard.

On February 15, 1952, the Se-
nior Class met after school to se-
lect a new representative to take
Rudy Szuch's place on the Student
Council. After the votes were tal-
lied,Harold Williamson was declar-
ed elected, and thus joined Jim
Lamont as a Senior dele-
gate.(Fred Sherzer and Clark White,
also Seniors, hold the presidency
and vide-presidency of the govern-
ing way)

ALUMNUS, INTER
VIEWED BY ARGO

While scanning the pages of the
school "Ye Dial" of 192k, your
alumni reporter came across the
name of Stephen C. Reid,which seem-
ed to strike a familiar chord. I
had seen something in the local
paper concerning this man, which
made me more anxious to fina out
what some of our alumni have
achieved since graduation, and how
nearly they have come to achieve
their school-day ambitions. He is
listed in the telephone directory
and found to be residing in East

Millstone. Your reporter asked some
pertinent questions and received

some very interesting answers,
Mr. Reid entered Rutgers Prep in
1923 after spending two years in
New Brunswick High School, and ac-
cumulated the remaining two years
of his high school education at
Prep,where he graduated in 192k.
While he was a Prepster, Mr. Reid

that he ceuld get better insatruc-

tien at Prep than at high scheel,
because in eur scheel there was a

DANCE (Cont. from pg. 1)

Besides the dance itself, the
events preceding the affair de-
serve mention in this column. The
dance was originally scheduled fer
Saturday evening, March 1, buta
deep snowfall during that day ne-
cessitated its pestpenement. The
deceratiens had been set up that
Friday, and were allewed to remain
there until the dance. After much
discussien and voting, the date,
Saturday, March 8, was selected,
and the scheel feooked ferward to a
fine affair. However, the cleg-
ging ef the water fountain with
bubble gum ani stuffing of the mers
teilets with paper forced Mr.
Shepard te anneunce the cancel-
latien ef the dance if the cul-
prit was net apprehended by the
student seuncil.

Ne one cenfessed to the sense-
less act, so on Friday afternoon,
the president of the Student
Council, Fred Sherzer, and vice-
president Clark White, utilizing
their authority, permitted nobody
te leave school until the matter
was cleared up. Your  reperter
thought that the difficult preblem
Was handled very well, and after
explaining that the scheel demand-
ed tha confession so that the
dance ceuld be held, Sherzer and
White had Mr. Helley talk to each
suspected persen and the affair
was again scheduled for Saturday
night.

THE RECOVERY OF THE GOLD

Wher fr

After the Civil War desperate men from all
cover the country flocked into New Mexico.

‘the worst type of these roamed about the

state with large herds of wild horses or cattle,

violating so many laws that the government
stationed soldiers in some of the small towns.

In one of these posts, a young army doctor
—Smith by name—and his wife lived quietly,
saving what they could from the doctor’s
scanty earnings. At this time there were, es-
pecially in the smaller towns, no_ reliable
banks. So every man had to take care of his
own money.

Dr. Smith had saved several thousand dol-
lars which he kept in a place known only to
himself. Without telling his wife, one day

_ he placed all the gold, wrapped in newspapers,
in a little old trunk used for paper patterns.

Among the few servants of the doctor was
a young half-breed, Manuel, from the nearest
town, where his mother lived with the rest
of her children. ‘Twice a year Manuel was
given a holiday which he spent with his moth-
er. When at last this happy time arrived,
Manuel set out early in the morning, bump-
ing slowly along in an oxcart. As usual, Mrs.
Smith had given him for his mother many
things which she herself did not want. Among

these were the ccntents of the little old trunk.

Late in the afternoon, the doctor came to
his wife with a troubled expression.

“Where are the patterns?” he asked ex-
citedly.

“The patterns? Why I gave them to Manu-
el,” she answered. “There wasn’t anything
there you wanted, I am sure.”

“Nothing I wanted! All our money was

there! Now all our savings are gone. What
shall [ do? Are you sure Manuel is honest ?
When did he start? He must be home by
this time.” There was no telling how long
Dr. Smith would have kept up this volley of
remarks. if his wife had not reminded him
that it was better to act than to talk. So he
started off to the Major to ask for leave of
absence and for a few men to go on the
lonely journey with him. But when the offi-
cer heard the doctor’s story, he shook his
head, saying, “Leave of absence I can give
you; but as to a guard, that is impossible, as
this case is private. I’m sorry, but it can’t be
helped.”

At first Dr. Smith seemed stunned. Could
he ride that long distance alone and then
come back at night with the gold? He must
risk it, or loose every cent.

In a few minutes he was on his horse gal-
loping towards the town where were all his
earnings. He arrived in the village just as
the people came out to gossip after their sup-
per. Immediately he went to Manuel’s home
where he was greeted by Sarah, the boy’s
mother, with, “Oh, you’ve come for your
money, have you? Well, it’s safe, down at the
Jew’s.” A load had been lifted from his mind.
Now it only remained for him to take the
money home. 5

The horse was turned down the little street
toward the Jews house. From all sides came
questions about his gold. Every one in the
town had been told about it. This of all
things to happen, with so many desperadoes
between the village and safety!

Taking the money from the Jew, the doctor
THE ARGO.

rode to the little tavern, where he paid his bill
in advance and made arrangements—in such
a way that all the loungers could hear—for an
early start in the morning. But before he
went to his room he looked. carefully about
the stable, seeing where his horse’s bridle and
saddle were hung. He did not sleep at all for
he was waiting for midnight to come, when
he intended to start for home. When at last
the hour came, he stealthily entered the stall
of his horse, saddled him, mounted and rode
away into the darkness.

On and on he went for an hour following
an easy path, but soon he came to a dense
thicket of thorn bushes. The horse pushed
on for a little way, then came to a standstill.
The doctor knew that he was lost. Lost, with
all the gold and in a lonely, dangerous place!

The only thing to do now was to wait for
morning to show him his trail. He sat on his
horse with his gun across his knees and two
pistols near at hand. Every little noise
startled him.

Suddenly his anxious ear caught an alarming
sound, small though it was. He listened care-
fully. Some distance to his right there was a
slight rustling in the bushes. Now it seemed
to be on his left, again in front of him, then

behind him. Had some of the desperadoeg
watched, followed, surrounded him? The
noise came nearer and nearer. Plans of es-
cape entered his mind, but he put them aside
as foolish. The doctor's grasp on his gun
tightened. He tried to peer into the pitch
darkness to see what caused the rustling, but
he could see nothing. The bushes moved near
him, first on one side, then on the other. He
was ready to fight for his money, alone as
he was. Now he could feel the bushes around
him move, then—warm breath! He was
about to shoot, when his horse gave a low
neigh answered by the herd of wild horses
which had surrounded them. His heart beat
more steadily at first, but then when he re-
membered what kind of men roamed with such
herds, he became more anxious. He sat per-
fectly quiet waiting for the horses to pass.
His ears were strained to catch any sound
made by a man, but as the herd walked slow-
ly out of hearing, none came. Again the
doctor was alone with his horse in the thicket.

How relieved he was, when it grew light
enough for him to find his trail and ride safe-
ly home without further adventure.

After this expetience, the doctor thought it
best to tell his wife all his secrets. /

 

A MESSENGER OF INDEPENDENCE

( !

 

At about eight o’clock in the morning of
July 5th, 1776, a messenger role into New
Brunswick by way of the Trenton turnpike
and stopping at the inn near the Steamboat
Dock only long enough to change his horse
for a fresher one, he rode swiftly along the
road by the river, and crossing the covered
bridge (where is now the Landing Bridge) he
soon disappeared down the road toward New
York. His passing through was at this time
a daily occurrence, for many messengers were
sent between New York and Philadelphia.
Only the two or three loungers around the
inn, therefore, took any notice of him.

“Well,” remarked the inn-keeper, “Philadel-
phia has sent her message a little early this
morning. It must be something important.”
(It was something important ; it was 0 copy of
the Declaration of Independence being sent to
the New York Assembly.) His audience
grunted assent, silently puffed at their pipes
for a while, and then began talking about the
amount of freight that had been sent by boat
to New York that morning and about similar
subjects.

They had not, however, been more than ten
minutes on this topic before another horse-
man came at high speed along the main street
THE

of those days) and, stopping at the inn,

asked for the best horse.

«ptt give it to you,” said the inn-keeper, “if
you'll tell me who you are.”

: «A messenger from Philadelphia,” answer-
ed the man quickly, “with an important mes-
sage. Hurry!”

‘The inn-keeper, satisfied by his manner, got
him the horse. He quickly mounted, and,
leaving his own horse at the inn, rode as fast
as he could in the same direction the mes-
senger had taken.

First the way led through a deep wood
where the tops of the giant trees interlacing
overhead kept out much of the sunshine and
thus darkened the road; then the Horseman
passed several farm houses, and open fields
stretching back from the road for half a mile

and then stopped by woods. .
Towards the end of an hour of hard riding,

thowever, the road became narrower, the
woods were deeper, and the fields fewer and

farther apart.

“Here,” thought he, as he passed through
a deeper and longer wood than the previous
ones, “here I may catch up with him. At least
I hope so.”’ And he pulled out two pistols and,
managing somewhow to cock them, he put
one into the holster and kept one in his right

hile he held the bridle with his left.

The wind was blowing due east and s
did not hear the sound of the Messenger’s

horse, which was now around a double

turn in front. The Messenger, however, heard

hoof-beats behind him and, thinking he was
being pursued, he bent low over his horse
and sticking his spurs into its flanks, urged it
on to its utmost speed. The Horseman swung
around the bend and there saw to his as-

tonishment the Mesenger only a hundred

ie: or I shall fire!” cried the Horseman.
- Messenger only bent closer to his
norse’s neck and trusted to the speed of the
two horses to shake the Horseman’s aim. The
later leaned forward on his horse, took care-
ful aim, and then fired first one pistol and then
the other. At the second shot the Messenger
threw up his hands and fell backward off his
horse, the bullet having struck him in the
back of his neck and gone upward towards
his brain. His horse fled in terror. The
Horseman rode up to the wounded man, dis-
mounted, and began searching his pockets.
Just then the Messenger opend his eyes and
then exclaimed, “My brother! Is it you? You
my pursuer? The despatch is in one of the
saddle-bags. You can’t catch the horse now.
—Another man is going by another way with
the same despatch.—You are beaten.”

“Ha,” said the Horseman, “the general of
His Majesty’s army, that all-wise man, did not
think of that! You a third son of an English
baron and a rebel! But you are not badly
wounded, are you?”

“I am dying,” groaned the, Messenger. He
was slowly bleeding to death. His broth-
er pulled out his handkerchief and tried to
stop the wound from bleeding, but could not.
All he could do was to sit and watch his
brother die.

“Brother, I forgive you,” said the Horse-
man who, soldier as he was, wept at this dis-
aster, “I forgive you, in the name of our ,
family, the part you have teken in the rebel-
lion. ould that my forgiveness could save
your life!”

“T want no forgiveness for—doing—right,”
answered the Messenger, faintly. Then, af-
ter a moment’s silence, he raised himself upon
his arm, looked his brother in the face, and
cried in a loud, clear voice, “T'm not an Eng-
lishman, | am an American. I die for my

country.” And he fell back dead.

TOM’S BURGLAR

éd.

Tom Wayne had never before been in such
a beautiful place. The great rooms, as large
as three rooms at home, were lighted by great
golden chandeliers; the hangings were of
scarlet; beautiful pictures of fairies hung
along the walls; chairs which reminded him
of the minister's chair at his church, looked
massive and grand; large rugs lay scattered
about; and sweet music filled the air. As
‘Tom wandered down a long hall, he noticed
every private room had the name of its in-
mate engraved on the door post; one was
labeled Cupid; another Psyche, and so on. At
the end of the hall the inscription on a heavily
barred door caught his eye—“He who enters
here need not value life,” it read. “My,”
thought Tom, “I wonder what’s in there! I'd
like to see; I wonder if I could lift those bars ;
I’m going to try anyway.” Tugging with all
his strength, he finally succeeded in unfast-
ening the door. It swung back and he stepped
into a dark cave.

The instant he entered, he would have given
much to be outside with thedoor fastened:
there near the other side of the cavern, and
hurrying toward him, was a ferocious three-
headed dog. Tom tried to run, but his legs
were hopelessly tangled up with something ; he
tried to scream, but he could not make a
sound; with one bound the great beast was
upon him, and—‘Whew, that was a fierce
dream! I’m sweating like a porpoise; I won-
der how these covers got twisted up like
this”; and with a relieved feeling he realized
that instead of being in the castle of Myths
and Fairies, he was in his own bed. But Tom
had something in store for him this very

 

night that the next morning made him feel
quite important, and made him a hero among

his playmates.

After his awakening, he lay for some time
wondering at his dream; then he thought,
“There’s a draught in here. Hettie must have
left a window open; guess I'll get up and
close it.” When not more than half way out
of bed, a heavy hand was clapped over his —
mouth, and a voice hissed in his ear, “Lay
still thar, kid, er I'll shoot yer!” And none too
gently was he forced back into bed. “You hear
now, if yer move er say a word till mornin’,
I'll shoot yer.”

For an instant Tom’s breath came and went
in gasps. “Burglars,” thought he, “I hope
he won't take my new watch. I wish my heart
wouldn’t thump so loudly, I’m afraid he'll
hear it. O, what shall I do?” By listening
closely he could hear the man cautiously feel-
ing his way around the room. Presently all
was quiet and he knew the fellow had gone
into the adjoining room.

Now Tom was by nature a plucky lad and
when over the first scare; he began to collect
his scattered wits. “If I could only wake fath-
er,” was his thought. “I can’t get to his room
without passing that burglar, and if I scream
he'd shoot me, so I don’t know what I can do.
Just the same I’m not as scared as that fellow
takes me to be. Let me see! O, I have it. If
I go down my stairs to the kitchen, I could go
through the dining room and up the front
Stairs into father’s room. But do I dare?
Suppose that man should hear me—he said
he'd shoot me and I don’t want to be killed. I
must wake father, some how. He could catch

Tom was up again and headed for the door.
When half way up the stairs, he ran into his
father’s arms. “Burglars! Catch ’em!” he
cried and sank down. Mr. Wayne quickly
searched the house, but no burglars were to
be found. They had fled, leaving their booty
behind.

It is needless to say that the next morning
it became known about town how that little
Tommie Wayne had saved his father’s big
house from being robbed; and at once Tom
was admired and smiled upon by all. ’07.

It was a beautiful day in June,
weeks before Commencement. Most boys
would have been very happy on such a
day, but there was one who was not. In fact
he was extremely discouraged. ;

A brilliant trail of shattered pool records
—state, national and international, marks
the swathe that Leonard Spence, swimming
for Rutgers Prep, cut in natatorial circles
this season. He broke the world record in

 

 

 

 

 

 

LEONARD SPENCE

the 220-yard breaststroke twice this year,
and as a member of the unique Spence bro-
ther medley relay team, he aided in lower-
ing the international time in the 300 yard
event last month.

At no time this season did Leonard meet
serious opposition in his breaststroke event,
despite the fast company that he kept
Scholastic records in the breaststroke and
freestyle are at new lows, due to his work
for Prep in 1931. Next year he returns. a
sure first place in whatever meet and event
he enters.

Brothers His Teachers

Leonard was born British
where as a young boy he spent many hours
in the water, gaining confidence, strength
and ease. In this fashion while under the
expert tutelage of his brothers, Spence de-
veloped the form which early this year

Lineup For Opening Game Of Season Still
ae

at

Coach Charles H. Brown has sent his
Rutgers Prep baseball squad through stren-
uous practice for the last two weeks in
order to have it ready for its initial contest
tomorrow against Morristown School at
Morristown. No definite line-up has been
chosen, although it is expected that Em
Raab will be on the mound at the com-
mencement of play, with Eddie Wood be-
hind the plate. The infield will probably
consist of Sorice, Passanante, Strapp, and
Sheldon. Coach Brown is undecided about
the outfield, for which he will choose from
Najavits, Cain, Boyarsky, Whittaker,
Nagy, Kraft, Kennedy, and Barcalow.

Ineligibles Have Chance

Coach Brown believes that those boys
who previously had been declared inelig-
ible will be able to partake in four games.
This will greatly strengthen the team, as the
ineligibles: Grossman, Hemerda, O’Donnell,
Capano, and Sheldon, have experience
They have been unable to play for Prep
owing for the most part, to the eligibility
rule of the state league which does not
permit a transfer from other schools to
play for twenty weeks. If arrangements
can be made with schools outside of the
league Prep will be able to present a fair
ly strong front. Without the five men it is

 

 

a case of playing with only one veteran
in the lineup and poor prospects for the

season.

WIN IN SCHOOL TRACK

 

Relay Won By Harvard In First Leg of

Harvard led Yale, 22-27 in the first part
of the intramural track meet at Neilson
Field Tuesday as this week’s Argo went to
press. The weight events, high and broad

jump, hurdles, pole vault,-and 220-yard run
were completed yesterday afternoon.

Linders of Yale took the 100-yard sprint
on the strength of his trial heat time which
was 10 3-5. Alexander was scored second
with Jones of Harvard and Kott of Yaie
third and fourth respectively.

Mile Was Close

The mile run was very closely contested
between Davis of Harvard and Sherman of
Yale. Sherman led over almost the entire
distance, but was unable to withstand a last
minute sprint by Davis, who finished in
5:02, against 4:04 for his adversary. Smith
and Miller, both of Harvard, took the re
maining two places. Hall of Harvard won
the 440 in 62 7-10 seconds, with Thomp-
son of Yale second. The 880 went to Lin-
ers of Yale, whose time was 2:12 5-10.
The Harvard relay team of Mayglothling,
Jorgensen, Piscicelli and Klauer had little
difficulty in overcoming the Yale combin
ation of Kott, Wheeler, Whittaker, and
Thompson,

dress, the students heard the Glee Club of
Central College in Pella, Iowa, which is
now making an Eastern Tour.

More than twenty-five Prep students
were present for Dr. Harrison's address,
which was a vivid portrayal of the condi-
tions under which Christian missionaries
work in a fanatical Moslem country. Dr.
Harrison told many anecdotes from his own
experience, illustrating the character of the
Arabs, and the difficulty that the mission:
aries have in carrying on their work. The
speech was rich in his own peculiar style
of humor, which served to make it much
more concrete and lifelike than a more
formal address would have been

Dr. Harrison is a graduate of the Uni
versity of Nebraska, and received his med-
ical degree from John Hopkins University
He has served for about twenty years as
a missionary to Arabia, and has written an
authoritative book entitled “The Arab at

School Opened in 1768 Under Direction of

PART II
On November 10, 1766, a committee of
six citizens, three of whom were trustees of
the new college, signed an announcement
which appeared in the New York Mercury
and in the Philadelphia Observer on Feb-
ruary 1, 1768 as follows: “Notice is here-

by given that a schooi is erected in New
Brunswick in New Jersey under the inspec’
tion of the subscribers, in which the learn-
ed languages and mathematics are carefully
and accurately taught by Caleb Cooper,
recommended from Nassau Hall (Prince-
ton) an able and well accomplished tutor
in these and other branches of literature.”
The notice gave full particulars of the con-
siderations which would commend
school to patrons,

In 1770 the college received an amended
charter, but the work of the school con-
tinued on without interruption from the
former date to the present time.

During the Revolutionary War the
school work was much interfered with by
the proximity of the enemy. It was deem-

ed advisable to remove for a) time from

that the records of the last. season.were ine

ketball records and the football records over
a longer period arz likewise incomplete, and
the same may be true in other sports.

Such a condition is to be regretted.
Athletic records should be carefully kept
as a matter of historical interest, for refer-
ence and for comparison with other sea-
sons, It is customary to publish complete
results of the year in athletics in Ye Dial,
but even that will be difficult this year, so
fragmentary are the records that the edi-
tors have in their possession

We do not intend to find fault with the
managers or others connected with the ath-
letic administration. We blame no indivi-
dual—only the system. No one of the man-
agerial staff knows exactly what his duty
is, and as a result the work is inefficiently
performed. This year several appointments
to managerships were not made before the
opening of the season.

It might be well to defer appointments
until the end of the season, and award the
title to the one who has worked the hard-
est. This 1s possible now that all schedules,
even in minor sports, are made by the ath
letic director. But by all means some stu-
dent should be appointed at the beginning
of the season, furnished with a suitable
book for keeping permanent records, and
charged with the duty of recording the com
plete data on every game in every Rutgers

Jersey Gazette, (1778) published at Tren-

LEONIDAS.

An Original Story by Paul Cook
(Continued)
CHAPTER III
A Spartan Boy's Day

Next morning the boys went to the river
and had a plunge. After this there was a
rought combing of the hair with the fingers.

The Iren now said, “Now line up for a
foot-race.”

After a couple of races a-trumpet blew
and the older boys taught boxing. Leonidas
didn’t like this. He liked the boys so much
he did not like to hurt them. Leonidas was
glad when a trumpet soon blew. This
meant the older men were going to drill
and the boys now watched. After this every
body had breakfast.

That afternoon the boys of Leonidas’
company went to the temple of Achilles.
In the morning the Iren had told the boys
that the next day there was to be a struggle
between two teams of boys. They went to
the tample to pray to Achilles for help.

CHAPTER IV
AT THE PLANE-TrEE GRovE

The day of struggle Leonidas’ company
was up at sunrise. Then they went through
their morning drilling and had breakfast
Then the company in the afternoon went
to the Plane-Tree Grove.

TENNIS PRACTICE STARTS

Tennis practice started only recently, the
delay being due to the bad condition of the
courts, Nevertheless the candidates for the
team have already displayed encouraging
form. Manager Kott has arranged a tourn-
ament to pick the best players, but it will
not be played until the men are in the best
possible pre-season form.

LAST PICTURES SNAPPED

The last pictures for Ye Dial were taken
on Friday, April 10, when a representative
of White's Studio in New York took pic:
tures of the honor students, Dial Board,
and tennis, golf, and baseball teams. The
informal snapshots, taken by W. Beardslee
and W. Whalen, have already been finish-
ed, as has almost all the editorial work,
only a few senior write-ups being left.
Roger C. Gay, the editor, said that he ex:
pected to have the book out by the first « of

June.

 

NEW BOOKKEEPER
Owing to Miss Terwilliger’s temporary
absence, a bookkeeper, Mr. Clinton C.
Baekey, of Maplewood, has been secured,
Miss Terwilliger is reported slowly im-
proving.

 

Coach To Choose ia, Quariutt From Six

Leaders In Trials

Bob Linders ran 350 yards in 40.5 sec-
onds, and Bull Clover came close behind him
in time trials held last Saturday on the
Neilson Field cinder track. Jim Greene,
Russ Sherman, Tom O'Donnell, and Larry
Alexander followed Linders and Clover in
that order. Norm Davis was unable to run
because of an injured foot.

Coach Donald J. McGinn declared that
the participants in the Penn Relays will be
chosen from this group, along with a sub-
stitute. Rutgers Prep will enter the one-
mile relay in the Prep School Class, each
man running one quarter mile.

The Relays are sponsored by the Univers-
ity of Pennsylvania, and will be held at
Philadelphia on Friday, April 24, and Sat-
urday, the 25th, with Prep running on the
latter date.

Although the Relays are classic events in
‘scholastic track circles, this will be the first
time in five years that Rutgers Prep will
be represented by a team, Other meets this
spring will include a triangular event with
South River and St. Peter’s High Schools
and a dual meet with Princeton Prep in
New Brunswick.

Hare and Hound Races To Be
Equestrians Meet Fridays

Held;

Horseback riding is offered this year for
the first time in Rutgers Prep and already
twelve boys have signified their intention of
becoming steady patrons of the sport
Through an arrangement with the Hamil-
ton Riding School in charge of Miss Jessie
Fiske, special rates are cffered the Prep
group which will ride once a week, Dick
Niederstein is student manger of the group
and Mr. and Mrs. C. Lloyd Neal ride with
the students as faculty representatives.
Although some of the boys are beginners
they are expected to ride with some form
with a few weeks practice. The remainder
of the group consists of experienced riders.
The first to report were James Thomp-
son, Bud Havey, Bonham Head, Harvey!
Wood and Willard Schenck, A few have]
not yet received their riding clothes but by |
next week the entire group is expected to
trot out with full membership.
The Prep period is from 3:00 to 4:00, |
and from 4:00 to 5:00 p. m. every Friday. |
After the boys have attained sufficient ex-
perience, they will take part in a treasure
hunt, hare and hound races and other com-
petitions,

 

 

TUITION RAISED

Tuition for the year 1931-32 will be|
slightly higher than it has been for we pase

five years, Due to the school adding real
teachers to the faculty in the past year, and
contemplating further increase, the change
is $50 for Trap boys and $25 for Day
boys. Students now attending the school
may, however, be registered at the old rate,
which is $1,150 for Trap students and
$325 for Day students.

The golf season ically started this
week when the Prep squad began practice
on the eighteen-hole course of the New
Brunswick Country Club, Charles Forney,
captain of last year’s team, is acting as tem:
porary manager, and is training the squad
for the first match,

Of the dozen candidates, Forney, White-
head, Klauer, and Whalen play the best
games, although the starting team is by no
means definite, according to Forney. “With
so many veterans from last year's squad re-
porting this year, I believe that our coming
golf season will be one of the best that we
have ever had.” he said.

enthusiasm proved to be well founded,
Started Last Summer

Spence began his career of record-busting
last summer when he took the 400 meter
senior national outdoor breaststroke record
from his brother Walter. Back in New
York bearing the badge of the N. Y. A. C.
he broke a whole series of indoor | marks.
First the 220 yard and 200 yard junior
Metropolitan breaststroke times were shat-
tered, then he repeated his record making
work in the same events in the senior Metro-
politan championships. Following that he
established the junior Metropolitan frees
style mark for 220 yards at Yonkers, N. Y.

New Record At Chicago

At the close of the winter swimming
season with Prep, Lenny went to Chicago
where he set a new world record in the sen-
ior national indoor 220 yard breaststroke.
He lowered the time of Tsuruta, a Japan-
ese swimmer, from 2:45 2-5 to 2:44 2-5.

Talked To Editor

Eight members of the Argo staff who vis-
ited the plant of The New York Times on
March 27, had an experience not usually
afforded groups of this kind when John H.
Findlay of the editorial staff paused to chat
with the visitors, He told the boys of his
frequent walking trips through New Bruns-
wick and seemed thoroughly familiar with
this part of New Jersey.

The itinerary of the Prep group included
views of the great presses as they turned
out part of the Sunday edition, the inter-

The party that drove into New York
consisted of J. Beardslee, W. Beardslee,

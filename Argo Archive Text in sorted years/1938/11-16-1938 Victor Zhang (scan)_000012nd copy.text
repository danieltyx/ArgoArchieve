Prep Closes
Undefeated Season

 

Victory Over George School
Increases Bid for State
Championship

 

The Rutgers Prep football team com-
pleted the most successful season in its
history by defeating a powerful George
School team by a score of 13-0 on Sat-
urday, November 12.

Prep scored within four and one-half
minutes of the op ig kickoff. George
Muha threw John Klucy a pass that was
good for twenty-seven yards. Two plays
later, Muha plunged over the center of
the line for the score. Klucy’s try for the
extra point was blocked.

Jim Pennington, thus making the score
yhirteen to nothing.
‘The fourth period was an even battle
until George School started a passing
attack that really clicked. Their touch-
down march was finally ended when they
fumbled on the Prep nineteen-yard line.
Werner recovered for Prep and immedi-
ately got off a quick kick that was the
most spectacular part of the game and
put the George School back on its heels.
The final whistle blew a few minutes
later, and once again the Prep team trot-
ted off, victorious.
Every man who played on the Rutgers
Prep football team this year deserves all
the praise that we can give him, They
played smart football all year to come
through the season undefeated and un-
tied, and scored on only once.

Theatre Club Views
“Victoria Regina”

 

Following the exciting Rutgers-Prince-
ton football game on Nov. 5, two carloads
ol Prep boys trekked into New York to
attend the performance of Victoria Regua
at the Martin Beck Theatre, starring
Helen Hayes and Werner Bateman.

Ernest Shepard, the author of the play,
has compressed into a two hour perform-
ance the most appealing and most drama-
tic moments of tne long reign of Britain's
great queen. Written with sympathy,
sentiment and humor, the play made a
great appeal, especially in its presentation
of customs and conventions in the grand
manner which unfortunately have van-
ishea from this earth. There were many
lumps in the throats of the audience as
they watched the httle g 1, just made
queen of her great country, progress
through her quaint and delicate courtship,
her first morning a wife, her crises
and marital, and finally her bout

fever secn Sarah Siddons as Lady Mac-
beth, Ellen Terry as Portia, or Katharine
Cornell as Candida, can at least treasure
among their souvenirs of great moments
in the theatre the memory of Helen Hayes
as Victoria. She portrayed the young and
frightened girl with charm, the head-
strong queen with vigor, and the great
widow of Windsor with a restrained
power which was amazing. There is
something about the grandeur of the

British Empire which inspires us with
there was something about Helen
s’ “Go it, old girl” that inspired us
with reverence.

Supporting Miss Hayes, in the role of
Prince Albert, the maladjusted and sen-
timental German, Werner Bateman gave
an understanding and harmonious per-
formance. Others in the cast were equally
good, but we especially admired Disraeli
and John Brown,

On Noy, 19 the Theatre Club goes to
New York again, this time to see Maurice

This is the first time that “Hamlet” has
been presented in its entirety in our gen-

much importance to all interested in the
greatest masterpiece of the English
theatre.

The class which was graduated from
Rutgers Prep last year seems to ha’
been very successful scholastically. Out o

five boys are doing other things, not be-
cause of a lack of scholastic ability but
because of sickness or the necessity to
work or to take some special train

John Charles Thomas, the noted bari-

presented the first program in the pres-

night, November 14. His renditions of mod-
ern and classical songs were greatly en-
joyed by a large group of Prep students.

The program was divided into four
parts, consisting of songs in German,
French, Italian, and English. Among
those presented were “Amuri, Amuri,” an
old Sicilian folk dance, and the aria
lome,” from “Herodiade” by Jules Mas-

Dr. Speer Speaks at
Rutgers Chapel Service

Secretary of Presbyterian For-
eign Missions Chooses Reliance
On the Past as Topic

Dr. Robert Speer, Secretary of the
Foreign M of the Presbyterian
Church, addressed a large congregation
in Kirkpatrick Chapel, Sunday morning,
November 13. Introduced asa Princeton
man, coming to New Brunswick as a min-
ister of peace, Dr. Speer spoke on a topic
which was of great interest and import-
ance to his sympathetic listeners.

. “It is ihe problem,” said Dr. Speer,
“of every generation to know what to do
with the past.” The first generation of the
Christian era was the only one that was
able completely to do without previous
tradition, and the only one which had
sufficient i ideals to. make them
a complete guide to th actions. e of
the present have not that faith, and are

2 It is only a

" fext tick us

aaa AS for action, because it is
of too brief duratio

of accumulated “presents” can we find

any guide for action. Illustrating his point

by a reference to the psychology of Will-
iam James, Dr. Speer insisted on the fact
that the past and the present are really
the same, and that the transition from one

to the other in either direction can easily

be made by the individual.

The efforts of Ghandi in India to base
all his plans and doctrines on the past
alone have resulted in failure. We must
not fall a victim to the simple theory
that what \ good enough for our
fathers is good enough for us. At the other
extreme is the attempt of the recently
deceased Mustapha Kemal Ataturk, who
ordered his historiographers to omit all
reference to the long period of Ottoman
rule from their new histories of Turkey.
We can no more alter the records of the
past than we can dispense with them,

Dr. Speer drew an amusing analogy
between what the correct attitude should
be and a college crew. A crew is com-
posed of eight men, all pulling forward
but looking backward. These men furnish
the power of the boat, but they are
guided and directed by the one puny
coxswain who looks always forward. Nor
should a man be considered of no further
use because he has lived too long. Dr.
Speer cited as an example Dr. Duncan
Spaeth, who was retired from Princeton
because it was thought that a man of
sixty-five was of no further advantage in
an Eastern university. Dr. Spaeth, how-
ever, was immediately offered the presi-
dency of Kansas University, and is now
one of the ornaments of Midwestern edu-
cation.

Dr. Speer recommended the Epistle to
the Hebrews as the best commentary on
the use of the past. St. Paul he con-
sidered one of the world’s most influen-
tial men, and he disposed of the notion
that the Epistle was written by a woman
by saying that no woman could have de-
scribed so efficiently the athletic con-

ALUMNI NOTES

Many of our recent alumni have been
heard from this year. Out of the large
graduating class of last spring, most of
the boys have remembered to write to
tier friends and to members of the fac-
ulty.

Jack Van Deman, of motor-boat racing

fame, and noted for his stop-light blushes,
is now in his freshman year at Alabama
Univ Tsity. His giant former room-mate,
Irving Kane, better known as “Kille
for his prowess on the gridiron, is a fel-
low student at Alabama. Both boys, ac-
cording to letters received from them,
are slightly dissatisfied with the South
and contemplate returning to New Bruns-
wick and Rutgers next fall.
Archie Smith *. our indefatigable
mailman of last year, is now going to
Tulane. Archie has requested that all of
his friends write to him, and, in return,
he will send them news of the goings
on in New Orleans.

Bob Stengel ’38, one of last year’s
honor-roll_ perennials, is attending the
University of Pennsylvania. He sent us a
letter near the end of the rush period,
informing us that he hadn't had to buy a
dinner for three weeks. Bob intends to
be a doctor, and, if he does as well at
Penn as he did at Prep, we predict a
brilliant future,

George and Bob Wilmot, two Prep
undergraduates last year are attending
other school. George, who was a letter
man on the swimming team and a foot-
hall player, is attending the Berkshire
School, Sheffield, Massachusetts. His
brother, Bob, now goes to Choate School,
Wallingford, Connecticut.

These exciting events have doubtless

of us. Don't you think that it is often
wise to sit down and reflect? As on the
question of chivalry at dances.

We all wonder where the chivalry of
yesteryear is. Why are boys no longer the
perfect gentlemen at dances? Ah, those
dances of old contrast greatly with the
dances of today. In ye olde days of the
hoop-skirt, the men were the perfect
images of politeness at dances, The ladies
were very formally asked for dances. But
today—oh, how times do change! The
bristling young sprout goes to the burst-
young bud and says in a bored tone,
‘C'mon worm, let's wiggle!”

Alpha House, Coach Petke gave his views
on the football team as a whole, and on
how they played in each of the victori-
ous games,
_[n the first game, against Morristown
Schol, Prep was very aggressive and
outstanding on running plays. John
Schmidt, captain of the team, called the
and played grand ball both
s and defensively. Fred Parkin-
son, in his first football game played a
very consistent game at center, especially
on the offense. Jim Pennington played
heads up ball all through the game, but
showed best when he picked up a fumble
and ran for a touchdown in the second
quarter.

When Prep came up against Kingsley,
although the opposition was not so strong
as in the game the week before, the Var-
sity made one of its best showings. In
this game the members of the squad who
had not played at Morristown had a
chance to show their ability. The two
who are remembered in this clash were
Jim Wells, who played on the defense,
especially when he would crash in, get-
ting some fine tackles behind the op-
ponents’ line; the other is Ed Kolakowski
who caught some mighty fine passes.
George Muha, the passer, and John Klucy
the receiver, made the winning combina-
tion of this game.

Newman offered stiffer opposition than
cither Kingsley or Morristown. The most
outstanding play of the game was the
“sleeper play,” which involved a_ pass
from Muha to Pennington. On the whole
Prep played a fine game offensively as

 

   

 

  

 

 

   

defensively.
Prep's next opponent was Pingry, whom
we defeated not only by playing better
ball, but also by outsmart the Pingry

men so neatly that it landed on
their ten-yard line. Werner has been play-

ing alert football all season, especially
with: Kicking and running. Ferd
Ratti, who has been turning out brilliant
ball all year, was the main spoke in the
wheel, with his shifty running and bul-
let passes. Another feature of the game
was that the second team played most of
the time, with Bill Malthaner calling
signals and running the ball very well.

Of all the games that Prep has played
this year, the Pingry encounter was the
best.

After having made such a fine showing
against Pingry, Prep met Montclair, who
outplayed them from beginning to end.
Montclair had punch and drive, and they
also played sounder football than we
did. In the second half, Ed Kolakowski
went in the game and gave the boys a
little pep; during this time Ed caught
several passes which paved the way fora
touchdown. John Kluey then returned to
the game, and, with a pass from Ratti,
he scored the lone touchdown in the
closing minutes of the game. Even though
we won the game, we were outplayed by
Montelair all the

Forgetting the Montclair game, the
team as a whole has played very well
through the season, On the defense and
in blocking on the offense, Werner,
Schmidt, Pennington, Kluey, and Mal-
thaner were the most outstanding players
in each game. Ferd Ratti and George
Muha have been sharing the honors in
passing and running, with Morfit, Gwiaz-
dowski, Werner, and Malthaner very

close behind the two leaders so far as
running the ball is concerned,

On the defense there has been brilliant
backing up of the line by George Muha,
John Schmidt, Tom Wenczel, and Bob
Beadle have been playing very aggeres-
si on the line. Jim Pennington and
John Kluey, the ends, have been crash-
ing in every time, and only twice have
there been any gains around our ends.
On pass defense Moynihan, Muha, Par-
nson and Ratti have been knocking
them down regularly. In five different
games our worthy opponents have only
completed nine passes.

Rutgers Prep Defeats
Montclair, 6-0, in Closely
Contested Game

Held scoreless for three periods by a
powerful Montclair team, the Prep eleven
finally scored the lone tally of the game
via the air route, and thereby remained
undefeated and untied.

Ed Kolakowski went into the game in
the final quarter and started the touch-
down drive by catching a beautiful pass,
thus making the first completed Prep
pass of the game, Muha then threw Pen-
nington a fifty yard pass which was com-
pleted on the’ nine-yard line for the
longest gain of the game. Two running
plays failed to gain, and then a running
pass from Ferdinand Ratti to John Kluey
was good for the vital six points. Kluey
made the catch by leaping into the air,
while covered by a Montclair man, and
by pulling the ball down with one han¢

As a token of esteem for his excel-
lent playing — and sportsmanship the
coaches and the team voted that Kluey
should receive the football. The game was

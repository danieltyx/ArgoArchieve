First Impressions
Of America

The last night on board of the “Wash-
ington” was a very exciting one for me
I was coming to a new country with new
people and a new language. “Tomorrow I
shall set my foot on American soil,” was
my only thought the whole time. A dream
of my childhood had become true. How
will it be? I talked much about my ar-
rival the next day, the tenth of August.
At about one o'clock we saw the first
lighthouses. and at three o'clock the first
skyscrapers of New York.

Slowly we entered the first signs of
the harbor entrance. In the far distance I
saw the Statue of Liberty, a statue of
promise for me. [t was surely the greatest
moment in my life when we passed the
huge monument, and the flag of the ship
went down to salute the token of New

  
 

__ people
‘began their work; among them
first Negroes 1 had ever seen in my life.
After the formalities with the custom
officials (they were so kindly that I could
not believe that they were officials at all)
I went home with my mother and a friend
of mine. The new environment was very
strange. The streets crowded with cars,
the big apartment houses, all made a
great impression on me. In the evening I
went along Broadway. Everywhere were
big tables for advertising, neon lights,
and so on, so that I had the impression
of seeing a movie. I could hardly believe
that I was really in America. Every!
“spoke to me, something that was very,
unfamiliar for me, and in the first few
days I could not get accustomed to it.

After a few days in a city with over
seven million inhabitants, I began to visit
my different relations. Thus I came to dif-
ferent parts of the country around New
York. I was very astonished to see a

country with pretty woods and meadows.

My thoughts about America always had

been connected with the words “big city.” I

was in different ports at the ocean shore, at

some lakes in New York, and at a vil-

lage near New York. Everywhere it was

beautiful and quict, and the part of
this peace I enjoyed most was that it was
not disturbed by a “Heil Hitler.”

The best impression of America thus
far has been my impression of the schools.
A few weeks after my arrival I went to
different schools to inform myself about my
acceptance in a Prep School. I was very
astonished to see no teachers with big,
long beards or bald heads. In Rutgers
I could not tell whether one man I saw

was a teacher or a student. Later I found
out that he was a teacher. I was not used
to such young instructors.

These were my first impressions of the
U.S.A. and I will always have them and
they will not change at all. I hope that
America will be a land with a great future
for me. | would like always to be so pleas-
antly disappointed as I was when I came
over to this country full of promise and

hope.

The movie column, written by Ri
and Gosse, gave concise and interesting
previews of several movies that will short-
ly appear in the New Brunswick theatres.
The gossip column left very little unsaid.
Much credit is due to the Editor-in-Chief
and the rest of the staff for the initiative
and persistence which was necessary to
fact that there was no supervision by any
member of the faculty, with the
of some censorship, there were very few

History classes. Every year there are
numerous essays turned over to the mas-
ters of English and History which would
be of interest to s 1 at large. Al-
though The Pioneer is not as yet the type
of magazine that been desired, it
could easily serve as a foundation for such
a one. It is hoped that The Pioneer will
broaden its literary efforts and will even-
tually become a periodical of which the
school can be proud. As its leading edi-
torial says, “it is our magazine.” We

that it will not be too “free-lance” to be
of benefit to the boys and to the school.

Yehudi Menuhin,
Violinist, To Give Second
Concert of Rutgers Series

 

On the thirteenth of this month, Yehudi
Menuhin, world-famous violinist, will ap-
pear in the second of the Rutgers Concert
Series. His program is as yet unascer-
tained, but to all music lovers it is sure
to be a genuine treat. Last season, after a
retirement of two years, Mr, Menuhin re-
turned to the concert stage and scored a
more impressive triumph than in even his
earlier efforts as a child prodigy. His
schedule included appearances in such far-
flung countries as Australia and New
Zealand, where in a startling way he lived
up to his already wide fame.

When it is considered that at the age of
three years, Yehudi Menuhin could play
the violin well, and that now at only
twenty-two years of age he is recognized
as one of the greatest violinists of the age,
it is extremely fortunate that the students
of the school can have this opportunity to

ir him.

On Mr. Menuhin’s reappearance in the
concert world last year, he played for the

take advantage of it. i

These three weeks that are

Christmas vacations do not seem important. They may seem just an oppor-
tunity to recuperate from Thanksgiving and prepare for Christmas, We
are apt to spend part of them recalling the good times of the vacation
that has just passed and the other part contemplating even better times
for the coming vacation. But we should remember that the marks that
we are receiving during these few weeks account for one-fourth of our
class grade for the first semester, Let's not begin our Christmas vacation

and including the sixteenth of December.

ENGLISH AS SHE IS SPOKE

tion consisting of a combination spelling, pronunciation,
and verb drill given to the senior English class produced some startling
results. We have often speculated on what the results of such a test would
be, but we cannot say that we were surprised at the outcome. The limited
vocabulary of some of our students, which is largely composed of slang
expressions, has certainly kept them from learning the finer points of
English pronunciation and spelling. Coming from the senior class, which
should have been exposed for the last three years to the effects of secondary
school education, this is still more disconcerting. It shows that the influence
of schools and teachers is not sufficient to counteract that of people who
are not careful in the use of English. It is interesting to note that tests in
grammar have shown an even more horrifying trend. We should sees
more attention to our choice of words, and even more to the way in which
use of those we choose.

SNOW

For the first time in many years, the inhabitan s of this region have been
more or less blessed by a white Thanksgiving. This has been true not only
for Thanksgiving but also for Christmas, New Year's and all the other
winter holidays. As this issue goes to press the white blanket is gradually
melting away, and what remains has turned various shades of gray. It is
possible that by the time THe Arco reaches our readers it will have dis-

 

appeared entirely. Y : :

There will always be a violent disagreement as to whether snow is desir-
able or not. The various winter sports—skating, coasting, and skiing—all
have their enthusiastic advocates who would not mind living in the arctic
wastes so that they could enjoy their sports the year round. Many of the
rest of us, however, have not-so-fond recollections—some of them in the
form of sore hacks and wrenched shoulders—of shovelling snow with the
wind blowing particles in one’s face, of spending hours pushing and pulling
the family car, Whatever our opinion, we will all agree that snow affords a
welcome change from the ordinary course of our lives.

 

 

PICK-UPS

Mr. Allen of Highland Park told us
the other night that his nephew, who was
captain of the George School football
team this year, had been greatly impressed
by our Prep team. It was, he thought, by
far the smoothest and most deceptive
eleven that he had played against all

year... We thought that it was pretty
good ourselves.
* *
And speaking of football, ... we must

 

comment on the fact that we have never
seen a season during which it was al-
most sure money to bet on the underdog
. - . It is also interesting to note that
by means of comparative scores (which
of course mean very little) one could
make almost any small team in the coun-
try a favorite over most of the large
teams . . . For example, take our own
Rutgers. We beat Princeton, who de-
feated who in turn tied Cornell,
who had just downed Dartmouth . . |
Thus the boys from the Banks might, in
theory, have been a favorite over cither
Dartmouth or Cornell... And who

knows but what it might be more than
just theory . . ,

Three more days until Thanksgiving va-

not much homework is being done, but,
after all, Thanksgiving comes only once
a year. Coach Reilly, of Rutgers, started
the swimming team on its way to what
we hope is a great season. Good luck,
mermen!

Tuesday, Now. 22.

“Tomorrow we go home” is the thought

ALUMNI NOTES

Paul Croonquist "38, former Rutgers
Prep swimming star made the unofficial
All-American Prep School Swimming
Team of John H. Miller, Mercersburg
Academy's athletic director and swimming
coach. Paul was the captain and lone star
on the ill-fated swimming team last year,
and won the State Championship in the
one hundred yard breaststroke. Far be it
from us to complain of Mr. Miller's rating
Paul as fourth on his team, but we believe
that he deserved first, for he twice, un-
officially, broke the National Preparatory
School record in his event by two-tenths
and seven-tenths of a second, respectively.
Unfortunately, during the week of inten-
sive competition with three important
uming meets, one of which was in the
National Interscholastics at Philadelphia,
Paul was suffering from a severe cold
and did poorly in comparison with his
two previous record-breaking sprints.
Edward Beach, ‘35, a member of the
Junior Class at Franklin and Marshall
College, has been appointed to serve on
the committee for the coming Junior Prom
at Franklin and Marshall. Beach was an
athlete on the football, swimming and
track teams at Rutgers Prep, and has dis-
tinguished himself scholastically and so-
cially at his college.

 

Basketball Practice Starts
Eleven Boys Survive Squad Cut

Mr. Rudy, head basketball coach, called
tice of the season on No-

 
  
 

  

turnout of forty boys, and great cothu-
siasm was shown. After the first few
Qays the squad was divided into varsity
and JV teams. Out of the entire squad
only cleven remained on the varsity.

The first few days of practice before
Thanksgiving and the squad cut were de-
voted only to exercises and general con-
ditioning. This basic work, which Mr.
Rudy emphasizes, is one of the important
factors of his many successful teams.

On returning from the holidays the
varsity squad was selected and was im-
tely put to work on plays and d
The boys chosen for the varsity

vs: Jack Bartow, Tony Gwiaz-
dowski, Bill Harper, Bill Hasbrouck, Ed
Kolakowski, Charlie Morfit, Harvey
Moynihan, Jim Pennington, John Schmidt,

Jim Wells, and Manny Werner.

Since Mr. Rudy has as yet uncovered no
individual stars to take the place of Joe
Tretsky of last year’s team or “Chick”
Mirsky of the team of two years ago, he
will probably not use either a pivot or
the system which he developed last year
based on Tretsky’s ability to work the
ball in alone, thus allowing the other four
men to remain in close. At this time the
system that he will use is not definite, but
it is likely that it will be one that will
take full advantage of the speed of the
squad. Likewise, there has been no official
announcement as to what defense will be
used but it is generally thought that it
will be a man-to-man defense. Regard-
less of what system he uses, however,
the team has shown great promise during
the preliminary sessions.

There are only three returning from
last. year's State Championship team.

These boys, Harper, Bartow, and Moyni-
man, will probably form a nucleus for
this year’s team. We hope that they will
imbue the squad with some of the spirit
which has carried it to two state cham-
pionships in succession. The coaching of
Mr. Rudy, which has contributed enorm-
ously to the team’s success in past years,
will no doubt continue to do so. With the
support of the school, this should be one
of our most successful seasons.

 

  
 

 

     

    

 

 

 

THE ARGO ;

Midget Football Team
Downed By Peddie In
Last Game of Season

Firm Rivalry Established
Between Juniors

In their final game of the season the
Rutgers Prep midget football team was
conquered by a greatly improved Peddie
midget eleven. The Prep team was showed

up on both the offense and defense by
the team which they had beaten earlier in
the year by a score of 21-7, The Peddie
team triumphed by their steady playing
and by the power and deception of their
running attack. They showed the results
of fine coaching by their remarkable im-
provement over the last time we played
them.

The highest spots of the Prep team's
playing were Capt. Potter's and Phil
Rust’s attack. They both exhibited their
usual brand of heads-up foo:ball, The rest
of the team, however, was not up to par.
Their playing badly lacked the spark and
fire which had been displayed in previous
games, This was due, in all probability,
to an abundance of over-confidence.

This game with Peddie established be-
yond a shadow of a doubt a firm rivalry
between the midget teams of two neigh-
boring preparatory schools. To date the
games have all been close and interest-
ing. Rutgers Prep has won two of the
football games and one of the baseball
games. Peddie has won one football and
two baseball games.

Last year, in the first game of their
rivalry, the Rutgers Prep football team
won an exciting game with a score of 7-0.
Renewing their competition in the spring,
Prep was once more victorious, defeating

the two footbal were evenly

 

   

 

 

split.

We hope that this rivalry will become
@ tradition and will continue with the
same fine sportsmanship that has been
shown in the games that have already
been played.

Midget football and baseball were intro-
duced to Rutgers Prep last year by Mr.

McClintock. They were received with
great enthusiasm by all the younger boys,
who, previous to this time, had had no,
or at best very little, organized athletics.
Mr. McClintock devoted a great deal of
time to the coaching of these boys and
worked with them daily, with the result
that he developed not only several fine in-
dual players, but also teams which
displayed an unusual amount of skill and,
more important, teamwork,

The values of these midget teams are
many. They develop boys for the varsity
squads by giving them training, experi-
ence and certain fundamental ideas of the
game and of teamwork. They allow boys
to participate in athletics with the proper
equipment for their protection. They cre-
ate school spirit in boys who previously
might have had none. But of all the
values that midget athletics have, the most
important by far is the fact that they
are under the supervision of an adult.
Most boys are almost sure to participate
in athletics, and, without proper super-
vision, there is a great possibility that they
will injure themselves by overdoing. This
is even more probable when the boys are
as young as those who engage in midget
sports. Therefore, the school, by offering
midget athlet with their aforementioned
benefits, is doing a great thing for the
younger boys of the school.

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

Menuhin To Give Concert

John Charles Thomas
Gives Concert In New York

This reporter was extremely fortunate

during the Thanksgiving vacation in being
able to attend another concert by John
Charles Thomas, this time at Carnegie
Hall in New York. Mr. Thomas sang
many of the songs which pleased his Rut-
gers audience and scored an even more
impressive triumph in this New York ap-
pearance. He opened the concert with an
excellent rendition of “The Song to the
Evening Star,” from Tannhauser, and
{cllowed this with many French and Ger-
man songs by old composers. The “Credo”
from Otello brought a great deal of ap-
plause from the audience which was
packed into this famous concert hall. The
most popular of Mr. Thomas’ encores
was the “Largo al Factotum” from Ros-
sini’s Barber of Seville, which made a
very effective closing for the first half
of the concert.
_ After a short intermission, Mr. Thomas
introduced Alfred Hay Melotte, one of
the best modern composers, whom the
students who attended the Rutgers con-
cert will remember as having been intro-
duced from the audience. Mr. Melotte ac-
companied Mr. Thomas in a number of
songs composed by himself, and both
artists were acclaimed. “Sing a Song of
Sixpence” was the most popular song of
Mr. Melotte’s composing: this was sung
by Mr. Thomas in his concert in New
Brunswick.

We were fortunate in attending this
concert with a friend who knows Mr.
Thomas, so, after it was over, we went
backstage and met both him and Mr.
Melotte. Mr. Thomas was warmly greeted
by many of his friends and admirers and
did not appear very tired in spite of the
strenuous program he had just completed.

Dr. Stearns Speaks
At Kirkpatrick Chapel

 

Dr. Alfred P. Stearns, former head-
master of Phillips Academy, Andover,
Massachusetts, gave an interesting sermon
in the Rutgers University Chapel
morning, December 4,
plained to an attentive au
necessary it is to follow closely the prin-
ciples of decency, sportsmanship and
honor, in order to keep our civilization
intact.

Dr, Stearns emphasized the importance
of the relationship between ethics or
morals and religion, and quoted the opin-
ions of many famous men to prove his
point. He then drew an interesting parallel
between a football game, where all the
standards of sportsmanship and honor are
exemplified in our own everyday life.
He compared the rules governing the
game and the conduct of the players to
those laws which are supposed to govern
life and the conduct of civilized people.

The University Choir gave their usual
excellent rendition of the hymns and an-
thems in the service.

Prospects Bright For
1939 Swimming Team

This year seven boarding boys and six
day students have expressed their will-
ingness to come out for the swimming
team. They are Beadle, Bill Clark, Cook,
Davis, Evans, Farley, Gosse, Malthaner,
Ratti, Rudolfs, Stogner and Styskal. Of
all these, Gosse and Rudolfs are the only
boys left from last year. Mr. Reilly, ably
ssisted John Winter, is coaching the
swimming, while Mr. Shepard will put the
divers through their paces.

The backstroke division has been filled
in the past by Rudolfs and Stengel. How-
ever, Rudolfs alone remains to be joined
this year by Bill Clark. Herman Mohr
is the sole candidate so far for the breast-
stroke. The 220-yard freestyle still re-
mains a fertile field for any enterprising
boys. Lyman Evans, Roy Stogner and
George Styskal will probably swim the
fifty yard dash, while Gosse, Farley, and
Davis try their skill in the stormy lanes of
the hundred yard dash.

The prospects for the diving team look
better than ever. Mr. Shepard, an expert
diver himself, is coaching this depart-
ment which consists of four boys: Mal-
thaner, Beadle, Ratti and Cook. The swim-
ming schedule cannot be announced as
yet.

acter. So appealing was her acting that
pity filled everyone's heart. Laertes, too,
weak and flattered by the King, called
for a certain degree of pity, as Mr. Smith
vividly portrayed his part in this great
tragedy.

It is a question hard to answer whether
one applauds more the acting of a play
or the lines and imagination of the author.
Both, however, in this production demand
equal appreciation, and even after five
hours of intensive drama, witnessing this
version of Hamlet can be called a privi-
lege.

(Continued from page 2)

It's really very peculiar and strange
how certain articles vanish in a certain
room on the second floor of the Gamma
House. Must be the campus thieves at
work,

A_ martyr is one who “ruffhouses.”
René, Red, Ed, Sid, and some other few
can tell you what I mean.

You should hear the masters sing
“Who Blew Out the Flame,” when the
lights go out.

You can always see hundreds of people
walking along the roads, There are those
fat people who are walking to reduce, and
there are those thin people who are re-
duced to walking.

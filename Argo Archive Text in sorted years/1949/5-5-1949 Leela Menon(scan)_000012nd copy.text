GLEE CLUB PRESENTS SPRING CONCERT

 

SPRING SCENE____-

For some time now we've preache
ed about the seemingly poor school
spirit and the small amount of ene
thusiasm to be found here. During
the last six weeks there has been
a definite turn for the better.The
informal dance on April 20 was
well supported, spring sports have
proved popular, a large turnout is
expected for the Glee Club Concert
this coming Friday, and the Spring
Formal is already on tho way to
SUCCESS .«

Now that school is only six or
so weeks from completion, everyone
seems to be in a happier frame of
mind, (reason unknown), The main
topic of conversation is baseball
and why Durocher should or should
not be suspended. While on the
topic of baseball, following is the
Argo's official prediction on who
will win the pennant race this year
in the Major League. One of the
following teams in the American
League will definitely take the
pennant: Yankees, Indians, Tigers,
Athletics, Red Sox, Browns, or tho
Senators, In the National League
we'll stake our reputation that
one of the following will clinch
the pemant: Braves, Pirates,Cards
Giants, Dodgers, Phillies, Reds,or
the Cubs,That's all the predicting
for now,we don't want to stick our
necks out on the results of the
World Series as yet.

SUCCESSFUL SPRING SWAY

The night lamps on the Rutgers
campus were burning brightly this
past Friday night, as the first
spring dance of the Rutgers Prep
School got underway. As the even-
ing drew to a close, the orchestra
had gained everyone's confidence
with their swing and sway arrange-
ments. As for picking dates, the
Prepsters polled 1000, and fromall
appoarances it seemed that thebest
looking girls in New Jersey were
holding a convention in the Prep
gymnasium,

We all owe a unanimous vote of
thanks to both the dance committee
and the faculty for making the af-
fair the success that it was,

SIGNS OF SPRING

"Tn the spring a young man's
fancy, lightly turns to thoughts
of love." This line from Shakes-
peare has been quoted all over the
world for several centuries. Many
people have been influenced by it.
Some say it brings out the artist
in yous Evidently someone in the
boarding school has had the artist
brought out in him. The Delta House
has been brightened up immensely,
especially those walls and ceilings
which tho artist dabbed with his
lunihous paint. In the same vein,
the Beta House has had a_ spring
cleaning, although not to the doe-
light of the faculty. To the
doarding students we might give this
advice, The scenery around New
Brunswick at this time of the year
1s very pretty, but it could get
depressing if you had to look at it
from the campus every week-end.

Chuck Jackson, a man about town

broken into our personality
A student all
the way, Chuck also finds time for
Argo, and other extra curricular
activities. Due to his excellent
work on the ARGO he has boen moved
up to the newly created post of
assistant editor. Next year he is
slated to take over Dave Wurtzel's
post on the YE DIAL. Having a tel-=
evision set in his room at home
has increased his popularity with

| day and boarding students alike.

Quiet as a mouse, but with a
grin that tells us that mischief
is there, Bill Fairhurst comes to
our attention, Bill is a hard work
er both in school and out. His
occupation is a noble one, for he
is a "hayseeder", a hick farmer in
other words, His thoughts of the
future are the best anyone could
have, for they are of the clergy.
Take it easy Bill, and don't drive
that Joep too fast.

Ever meet a southern gentleman
farmer? If you haven't stop around
at the Gamma House and look up
Frank Powell, This easy-going ren-
egade from just north of the Mason
Dixon line, with his Eastern Shore

dialect, manages to stay out of
trouble.se.emost of the time. He
was on the football squad, which

is his first love.He is also Fea-

ture Editor of the ARGO, having
just been moved up to _ the post
left by Chuck Jackson, His main
worry, aside from school work, is
helping Walt Quinn solve his many

problems, while trying to keep up
with a girl named Sandy.
Marshall Watts, a citizen of

this fair city, has as a hobby the
art of swimming, at which he is
most proficient. Although he isn't
a member of the ARGO staff, much
credit is due him for the time and
effort he has put into assembling
it. He and a certain blond-haired
friend have had a race for high
marks since grammar school,

mr holley_

It has come to our attention
that we should have a day of com-
memoration for some noble servant
of this institution. It has been
Suggested to us many times that he
be a member of the faculty. So we
have decided to have a commemora=
tion day for Mr. A. Z. Holley. We
will call it simply "Holley Day".
This day will be held at Mr. 4
Holley's convenience, and will be
climaxed by collection among the
students to buy him a car and othe
necessities of life, We feel tht
this is a fine way to give credit
to Mr. Holley for all that he has
done for Prep,

A person well deserving:'a ded-
ication is Mr. Donald S. Lowe. No
person can go through life these
days without a thorough knowledge
of English. Mr. Lowe is here to
make sure that we get it. Aside
from classes, he coaches the ath-
letic squads of the boarding schod
in the afternoon. As an umpire
and referee he has met with sharp
eriticism but has always won out
in the end.(don't they always? )We
are sorry that we don't have some
picture of Mr. Lowe which would
pring out all his virtues,but our
photography staff is busy on Ye
Dial, and has been unable to sub-
mit any pictures. Hats off toyou
Mr. Lowe, your"gentlemen" thank
yous

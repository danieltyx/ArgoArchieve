HATS OFF

With the issuing of this final
ARGO, we, of the staff, are able
to look back over a year of prog-
ress, not only for the paper,but
for the school as well, Our teams
had a good year, as did all other
extra curricular activities,

as this is the final editorial
I would like to take the opportun-
ity to bring to light the accom-
plishments of the various workers
on TH «saRGO.

Assistant nditor, Chuck Jackson
was probably the most outstanding
case of a person fitting into a
pattern: of_godad.work. There wasn't
amoment all year that Chuck was
not around
ways to produce this sheet, and it
is doubtful whether the paper
would have been the cuccess it was
without him,

Feature iditor, Frank Powell,
was another worker who was indes-
pensible,His column, TIL} SPOTLIGHT,
was a welcome addition to every
LSSUC.

gune 3, 1949 = Pte
Dick Connolly, our Art aditor,
was responsible for many of the

fine drawings, headlines, and our
new heading. He did a most credits
able job,

Although a Freshman Bernard
Rineberg was a great asset as the
Sports dditor., He was always there
at meetings and other odd times to
help out, andfor that alone he
should be praised,

Gene Ginsberg and Gil siseman
both turned in excellent pictures,
that I am sure were one of the most
popular parts of the paper,

Freshmen, James Lamont, Charles
Tucker, and Bill Cramer, started
off their journalistic careers at
the beginning of the year, and if
past peformances are any indication
they should be all great assets to
future Prep publications,

after mid-terms Gerry Shinn and
Stu Jay came out for TH ARGO, and
the few articles that they handed
in were always top-notch.

Handling all social events were
Tom Murray, Angelis Alexandris, and
Iiason Martens, Tom and Angie could
always be called on to furnish
data on school functions, while
Mason handed in timely articles on
concerts, etc,

Vince Marascio and John liiske
were two of the more quiet members
of the staff, but that did not de-
tract from their effectiveness,
Vince helped with pictures, while
John helped edit sports articles,

Three ARGO memle rs who were val-
uable in the early part of the year
were: Jack Anderson, Neil MacFarlan
and James Rothschild. Although com-
mitments forced them to abandon
the paper we look forward to their
assistance next year,

That about takes care of every-
with Tit ARGO, All
there is left to say is thanks for
a fine year,

Wa Quinn

MR. GROVE

One of the men who certainly
deserves mention is Mr. Jack B.
Grove, ovr Latin and German teach-
er, who doubles as leader of the
Glee Club. For both jobs this in+
structor is perfectly fit for he
is a fine singer and organist.

Mr. Grove is known to all peop-
le in his classes as a man bent on
making them learn their work well,
and elso as one with a strictly
humerous side. He is as eager as
anyone to make each day enjoyable,
and his many jokes and witty epis-
odes add zest to the class work,

One off the most popular extrae
curricular activities in the sch-
ool is the Glee Club, which pro-
vides pleasure for members and non
members alike, Under lir. Grove's
excellent leadership, this group
has become one of the best of its
cind in this section of the coun-
try, as anyone who has attended its
concert. will agree wholeheartedly,

Surely we owe a large debt of
gratitude to this teacher, a true
artist in every sense of the word,

SPORTS SUMMARY MR BLAKE

 

In this issue, we thought it
would be appropriate to include
Mr. Guy F. Blake, our jovial Math
instructor. Though, personally,we
have sometimes been inclined to
succunb to lethargy in his classes,
it is in spite of his fine teach-
ing, and keen sense of humor, and
the endless feud of Johnson ViSe
Blake, which recently culminated
in the removal of the former by
the latter,

He is also to be remembered for
his famous J.V. basketball teams,
and the numerous after lunch pool
games, On Wednesday he played the
iiditor of this sheet and emerged
triumphant, as did the rest of the
facultye

SPRING FORMAL

One of Pprep's most successful
dances was held on May 21st. in
the gymnasium, The spring formal,
whose theme was anyone's guess was
well attended and well enjoyed by
the participants.

The Ten Gilberts ( of whom there
were only nine) supplied the mel-
odious dance rhythms,

The aformentioned decorations
were prepared by the able hands of
Red Gorman and Hans DeBlecourt,
Gene Ginsberg andWalt Quinn aided
in placing the lights.

Of course we cannot fa get the
paseball team's great assistance,
offered by Nr. Holley, The attrac-
tive murals were prepered by Joe
Lebow and Don lioffitt. They were a
great asset to the dance.

And belive it or not everyone
stayed till the end.

GOOD LUCK
IN YOUR EXAMS

THEATRE CLUB

It is about two months since we
started digging up the old theatre
club. Now that the digging is
about complete we are pleased to
report that 46 people have signed
the list and we are ready to begin
lining up shows,

These are the details that we
have found out to date. A train to
and from New York would cost $2.60
while a chartered bus only 41.25
round trip. The show tickets will
cost $1.20 apiece (balcony), The
shows that we plan to go to see
are to be decided by you who sign-
ed. A list of about 6 dr 8 shows
will be passed around, and you will

check first,second,and third choice

Because of the difficulty of get-
ting tickets, we will have to work
the choices this way. Soon after
midyear exams a meeting of the clb
will be held to settle all final
details.

StUD YE

study-

deer, found me, and his name is
Dave Wurtzel.

Dave is a fellow who's activi-
ties are just about taken for
granted. Other than major sports
he is in just about everything
that comes along. An excellent e-
lectrician, scholar, and chief of
the student kitchen corps. He is
very well liked by his fellow mem-
bers of the human race.

Hats off to you Dave, and best
of luck in everything you under-~
take.

On January 31, at 8:40 A.M. the
first mid-term exam will start.

There will be two sets of exams
given every day from January Sl to
February 4.The second exam . will
start at 11 o'clock and end at 1.

There should be a lot of effort
put on these examinations,for they
count one/half of the term grede.

“MACBERH’ AT PRINCETON

Last Monday night, the Margaret
Webster production of William
Shakospeare's "ilacbeth" was given
in Frinceton's MeCarter Theatre..
It was for the benefit of the NaJ..
C.-.student canter fund.

The production had two nearly
continuous acts, lasting approxi- -
mately 23 hours. There were a few
things that were not ontirely nec-
essary in a theatre of this size,
such ‘as tho smallness of the stage
set,.and the use of recorded, in-
stead of live music.

All in all, it was very woll
done considering that the company
is always travoling, and they had
pre vaeany given a matinoe that

ball were Hines and Vasvary who
made 11 and 8 points respectively.

scored Newark Academy, winning 48-

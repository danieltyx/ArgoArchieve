“JUDGE NOT, THAT YE BE NOT JUDGED.”

Tick—tock—tick—tock. How many more
times would he hear that awful, monotonous
sound which struck abject terror to his inmost
soul! Not that the ticking of a large clock,
slow as that ticking may be, was fearful, but
that which it foreboded. Nearer and nearer
it they came, but so slowly that their approach
was imperceptible. Ah! how refreshing those
cold ends would feel to his burning eyes!
When those two iron rods, one for each eye,
should reach him, would they kill him instant-
ly? There were at least six inches between
his eyes and those irons. How long would it
be before he felt them,—they moved so slowly ?
But how long had he been there? He realized
that he was bound, and sweating from horrible
mental agony; he could not see beyond those
ends, nor could he remember being brought
there. How did he come there? His mind
began to wander and he saw a face—a man’s
face; then the body appeared, and the iron
ends were shut from his vision and he saw a
room, the court room, and he himself sitting
on his judge’s chair listening to this man’s
story. Now the case came back to him. This
fellow was the son of the prisoner convicted
of murder in the first degree. His gaze shifted
to the criminal, a bent-down, white-haired old

man, with a careworn, listless look. Bah! the
idea of a man’s hair turning white from tor-
ture. Why, hair so white as that could only
belong to old men,—and was this man not old
cnough for white hair? But what was this
man’s son saying?

“Look at him, your honor, a miserable old
man! He was not so a week ago. He was
seized by a gang and tortured unmercifully.
In that one night his hair turned white and he
lost his mind. They freed him, when they
were satisfied, and left him all but dead, nor
thought of him again, and went on their way.
I can see them stop and enter that cursed tav-
ern and spend their victim’s money.

mugs are raised and—the leader drops his and
becomes deathly pale. They all turn. See!

immense axe! He walks in and closes the
door, God! It is my father! Suddenly he
raises his axe, runs to the end table, leaps on
it, and dashes over the long table covered with
good cheer, up to the man at the head. He
raises that and with an

him in half! The gang runs out in mortal ter-
ror and the prisoner falls off the table uncon-

scious! When out of range the gang collects.
They put away the evidences of their crime
and accompany the police, summoned by the
inn-keeper. Then the prisoner is taken to the
jail, where he comes to his senses only par-
tially. Look at him! He hardly knows his
predicament, Oh! believe me! That man
never had a white hair in his head before! I
tell you he did the deed when out of his mind!
For God’s sake, do not judge hastily !”

Tick—tock—tick—tock! Everything was
gone but those two ends! Only an inch away !
His eyes almost started out of their sockets !
What was that? A clock; a man, the prison-
er’s son, is standing beside it with a smile on
He opens the case and is about to
seize the pendulum, but with a shake of his
head he closes the case again. The tortured
man feels his mind slipping from him and he
strains every muscle, first to reach those mur-
derous rods and hasten death, and then to es-
cape them. But it is useless, and with a hid-
eous scream all is over.

The next thing the judge was conscious of
was the ticking of a clock. At first he lay still,
but gradually he realized that he was in his
bed and that the sun was creeping into his
room, His head was paining fearfully and he
was conscious of a cold sweat over his body.
Suddenly an idea struck him and he sprang
out of bed and ran to his mirror, His hair
was white! The poor man sank into a chair

and cried hysterically.

His people found him an hour later in an
unconscious state and put him to bed, where
he was kept for a week by his physician; but
as soon as he was able he looked more care-
fully into the case that was the cause of this
nightmare, and found the son’s story to be
true. The band was convicted and their vic-
tim sent to a sanitarium at the judge’s ex-
pense. The judge himself has always remem-
bered that dream, and has learned to hear both
sides of every case without partiality, a gift
possessed by a very few.

ARGO
AN AMAZING ADVENTURE.
(Concluded from last month. )

When I came to, the sun streaming in my
face found me lying with my head close to
the embers of the dying fire. At first I was
dazed and could make out nothing of my sur-
roundings, but as I saw the empty revolver
lying on the floor and a neat round hole in
the window pane I began to have a hazy rec-
ollection of the events of the night. I rum
maged among my provisions and managed to
find a small amount of “ready to eat provend-
er.’ After I had had some nourishment I
set out to ascertain what had happened dur-
ing the night. I now had a clear idea of all
the events and the figure seen in the lightning
flash was clearly set in my mind. I examined
the room and found nothing out of place. The
window was shut and there was but one bullet
hole in it, whereas the whole chamber of my
pistol had been emptied. I finally decided
that the window must have been shut by my
visitor before his departure. Next I went to
examine the outside of the house, and imagine
my dismay when I saw a trail of blood lead-
ing from the side of the house.

At once I determined to follow the trail and
find out what my visitor had been. I had
thought it had been in truth of the ghost world,
but now I knew that it was mortal. I went
to the shack to put on my khaki suit. Just as
I emerged from the door, with my rifle slung
over my shoulder and a generous amount of
lunch in my pocket, I was met by what ap-
peared to be an official delegation from the
village. I could converse in the Spanish lan-
guage after a fashion, and with some trouble
I caught the drift of what they wanted.

They had seen an apparition, or Tather they
had heard and imagined they had seen it.
Well, anyway, from what they imagined they
saw they had a right to be scared. It had
been accompanied by the worst devils of thun-
der and lightning. The height of the creature
varied anywhere from. ten feet to the size of

 
THE

a house. It had let out a most peculiar moan-
ing sound, and had, last but not least, left a
warning in the middle of the Fire Circle, as
they called their meeting ground. It was a
demand that the people of the village should
leave a certain sum of money and valuables in
a designated place outside the village. Fur-
thermore, it warned them to have me sent out
of the village, or else kill me within a week,
but as I had made some friends among them
they had determined upon the former course.
Also it was demanded that by no means should
the grave be touched, nor should a citizen ap-
proach it. As a punishment for the disregard
of these orders the town would be perpetually
haunted by the ghost and that one child should
disappear from the village each day, and after
the children were gone it would begin on the
adults. They were thoroughly frightened, and
also thoroughly determined to obey the com-
mand of the haunt. They then served me my
walking papers. I laughed at them and tried
to quiet their thoughts and fears, but to no
effect. If one thing makes a Mexican more
obstinate than he naturally is it is fear. Well,
I had to tell them that I was going hunting
into the forest and also to promise to return
within the week, the latter being easy enough,
as I was satisfied that I had struck a rich
pocket of ore, and was going to return any-
way. When they had gone to the loafers’ cor-
ner to talk it over, I set off to trail the blood.
I followed it right out the village, up the
mountain and ‘down the valley on the other
side. From there it turned and went directly
towards the clearing. After three hours of
hard trailing, during which I expected to come
on my victim any place, as I could not see how
any human could stand the loss of so much
blood, I saw ahead of me my black haunt, only
unlike a spirit it was staggering and groaning
like one mortally hurt. Before I had ap-
proached five steps nearer it had fallen and
lay perfectly still. I rushed up to the fallen
body and at once saw that my ghost was no

ghost at all.

heavily. Bending over the unconscious form
I did what I could to allay the bleeding. When
I had stopped the flow of blood, going to a
nearby spring I obtained a cap full of water
which I poured over the wounded man. Then,
as he showed no sign of regaining conscious

ness, I picked him up and carried him back to
the village. It was a terrible journey, and
how I got there I don’t know. I at once got
a doctor, who brought the man back to con-
sciousness. The man asked if there was any
hope of his recovering, and the doctor answer-
ing no, asked for a priest. The father having
come the man made his confession. He said:
“From the dread of the villagers of the her-
mit’s grave I conceived the idea I was per-
fectly safe there, as no one came near. Then
| selected my disguise, and upon being discov

ered in a house I would by means of groans
frighten my discoverer so that he was helpless.
Then I would escape back to the grave, where
no one would follow me, But the young
Americano is different. He did not seem to
fear the ghosts. I plundered this way for
years with no fear of discovery. In this time
[ have laid up great wealth. It is hidden—”
The man was seized with a hemorrhage and
before he could finish his sentence was dead.
We hunted high and low for that treasure but
never found it. The mystery of the ghost of
the hermit was solved.

A STORY.

I am going to write a story. Not that 1

ary daughter have asked me to set down
some of my western experiences. Just now |

article to make the people laugh:—he said it
couldn’t be done, and then went ahead and
tried, with the result that I smiled to myself
and chuckled mentally. So [ will do my best.

cattleman, “Kaiser” Bill by name. I will tell

changing the prairie dialect to good New York
English.

“Once when I was young, and had a better
opinion of myself than most folks, I was work-
ing for the Z— outfit up north of here. It
was in the spring, when there wasn’t much
doing, that we rounded up a band of wild
horses, whose leader was a fire-eating, ram-
paging, man-killing mustang. Most of the
horses were broken in a short time, but we
couldn't do anything with Beelzebub, as the
mustang had been named, and no one dared to
go very near him.

“Late in June I went into Mexico on some
business, and didn’t get back till August. In
the meantime some fool greenhorn from the
cast tried to ride B., and got his neck broken
for his pains. I had learned considerable that
summer, and thought I knew enough to have
a try at the horse, so when I had time to spare
we brought him out and got ready. First we
threw him and held him fast by ropes on his
legs, while I bridled him with rawhide reins
and a cruel Mexican bit, and fastened the sad-
dle with a double cinch. Then we climbed the
fence and turned him loose. Well, sir, you
should have seen him cavorting round that
pasture trying to get rid of the saddle. He
certainly acted as if his namesake was in him
for fair. After a while he quieted down some-
what, and then we caught him again and held
him while I got on. I took a good grip with
my hands on the bridle and my knees on his
sides and signalled to turn him loose. I can’t
find words to describe the horrible struggle of
the next few minutes. He seemed to know
every trick for unhorsing and injuring a man
that was invented. He bucked and
reared, jumped up and down, rolled over, so
that I had to leap from the saddle to avoid be-
ing crushed, and dashed hither and thither at
frightful speed, only to suddenly stop short in
his tracks and nearly send me over his head.
The only effect of the bit and spurs was to
enrage him to newer bursts of frenzy, until
once I was not quick enough when he rolled,
and he crushed one leg under him. Immedi-

ever

 

THE ARGO

ately a dozen men started to help me, but the
only thing that saved my life was a small dog
which came barking at B. Now, he didn’t
like dogs, so he started for the gate in the
fence which had just been opened to admit a
couple of cowboys with lariats, and where the
crowd was the thickest. He was too quick for
the horsemen and dashed through the crowd.
knocking down several in his way.  Fortu-
nately, or otherwise, he did not flee for the
open prairie, as every one expected, but for
his stable, where he turned at bay in his stall,
dripping and panting, but still with fire in his
eye. :

“T was cared for immediately, but it took
three months for my leg to heal as good as
new. Then, despite the protests of my friends,
I determined to have another try at the horse,
but with more precautions. The day before,
two cowboys, by ropes fastened to his neck
and their saddles, led him between them for a
ride of about fifty miles, which tired him
enough to make him submit to a rubbing
down. Then early in the morning he was
taken for another thirty miles at a fast pace,
and then delivered to me. I mounted as be-
fore, but instead of an enclosed field, out on
the open plains. He started off as spicy as
ever, but I could detect some signs of weari-
ness. I got him headed east, and I kept him
going all day, circling to the left, until finally
T got back to camp late in the afternoon, hay-
ing covered upwards of sixty miles. B. was
utterly fagged out and I was pretty tired my-
self, but we had come to understand each
other and were on pretty friendly terms. This
is sometimes the only thing to do with a spir-
ited wild horse,—tire him out and so break his
spirit. It nearly always works, and it did in
this case, for he became one of my best horses,
and I rode him for more than a dozen years.
He even became fairly good-natured, but we
never changed his name. I still have one of
his descendants, as fine a horse as you’d wish
to see, and if you come around to-morrow I'll
show him to you.”

ARGO 121

A little over a year ago the Young Men's
Christian Association of Rutgers Preparatory
School had the honor of entertaining the As
sociations of other preparatory schools in the
State of New Jersey meeting in convention in
New Brunswick. A large debt was thus in-
curred, which was all paid up at the beginning
of this year excepting twenty-three dollars.
However, Dr. Scudder and the Y. M. C. A. of
the college made an agreement whereby he
was to give a public lecture on the Passion
Play for the benefit of the college association,
provided they used the first twenty-three dol-
lars of the door receipts in paying off the debt
against our Student Association. This lecture
was of course to be given free on the part of
Dr. Scudder. He gave the lecture at Kirkpat-
tick Chapel, and the college Y. M. C. A. was
fortunate enough in collecting this amount and
considerably more. Hence the students of this
school appreciate what Dr. Scudder has done
in releasing the Student Association from this
debt, and take this opportunity of expressing
their thanks toward him.

 

Although our Southern trip was not a
wonderful success in the way of victories, yet
we feel that in all other ways it was a great
success,—for did it not show that the town
had an interest in the school? We have got-
ten out of the trip a lot of good practice and
we have been able to get the experience. Hard
luck followed us, for after the first game
Ziegler, our only pitcher, was forced to leave
us, and the water made some of the fellows
sick. Nevertheless we would not have missed
the trip for the good it did. It is up to the
fellows to show those merchants and profes-
sional men who helped us that we appreciate
a whole lot what they have done to help us,
and that we mean to pay them back to the
best of our ability. It is a good thing for the
school to be popular in the town, for it helps
both the town and the school in more ways
than one.

We wish to thank our friends who con-
tributed to the fund, and who made the trip

 
122 THE
possible, in our most sincere manner, and to
assure them that in the future we will do our
best to make them feel that we apprecite what
they did.

pear in our next month’s issue.

A HOME THRUST.

Many years ago, in a New England board-
ing school for boys, the principal was a learned
clergyman—a preacher of long sermons and a
strict grammarian.

One night, after 10 o'clock taps, when all
the boys should have been in bed, he was pass-
ing silently through the dormitory when he
heard sounds of revelry from a darkened
room. He rapped on the door. Silence with-
in. Then:

“Who's there?”

“It's me—the principal. Open the door.”

“Ha, ha, ha-a-a! You're a liar! If it was
the doctor he would say ‘It is I.’

Seeing the force of this argument the doc-
tor passed on.—Philadelphia Saturday Even-
ing Post.

THE BASKET-BALL TEAM.

The Rutgers Prep. School Basket-Ball Team
has ended another season in very creditable
style, having won nine out of twelve games
This record is a favorable comparison to those
made during the previous seasons. One thing
making the difference was that there was no
bad feeling among the players, as has some-
times been the case. The team was the best
scholastic delegation in the State next to New-
ark H. S. and Lawrenceville. The team work
was fine and the playing was usually steady.

In two games Prep. came back in the second
half and overcame their opponents’ lead, win-
ning the game, and both times they were away
from home. The first team Prep. ever had
lost but one game. The second team won but
two games. Last year’s team won but two
games. The team was coached in fine style by
Ziegler. Two men were left over from last
year’s team, Searle and Parkin.

With the progress of the season the team
grew steadily better, until at its end they could
beat most anything. One of our defeats, from
Plainfield H. S., was unmerited, and it was
plainly seen that we had much the better team
of the two. They played their best, in the last
Irving game, when they came back in the sec-
ond half, and won after it looked as if Irving
had the game cinched. It was then that they

showed their high fighting spirit when, in a
poor, small gym., with hard baskets, they se-
cured a seemingly impossible victory, giving
Irving the only defeat of the season on their
own court. There is plenty of material left
for a good team next year.

THE PLAYERS.

Captain Parkin. Left guard. Height 5 ft.

A. C. Busch sprained his ankle in early
base-ball practice and was seen about the Trap
on a cane for several days.

Mrs. Scudder gave a most delightful dance
at the Trap, Friday evening, March 3. About
twenty-five young ladies from town were in-
vited by her, and with fine music by Hart’s
orchestra the affair was carried off in fine
style. There were fifteen dances in all. Re-
freshments were served after the tenth.

Mr. Merrill did not appear on the floor at
the dance, but he and Miss Roberts were seen
alone in the parlor.

The following’ suggestions were sent to the
ARGO office :

For Mittag: Use Pompeian Massage Cream
(good for the complexion).

For Dougherty : Buy some tobacco (once
in a while).

For Marquis: Not to shoot Gonzalez.

For Reeves: Use “Fat-on.”

For Stinson: Get married, and be’ done
with it.

For Todd: Start a Salvation Army at the
Trap. :

We can make our lives sublime,

Bulletin.
Several good stories and a well-written ex-
change column make you one of our most
welcome exchanges.

You are a very concise paper.

Caravel. Your cuts are excellent, and with
plenty of illustrations you make a pleasing ap-
pearance. You also ‘have a good literary de-
partment.

Knight, You need more departmental cuts.
“The Captain’s Story” is well written and in-
teresting. All things considered, you are good.

M. A. S. Monthly. Your literary depart-
ment is good, as is also the editorial page.
Your exchange column is good, but we would
suggest a more prompt receipt of exchanges.

Shucis. You show improvement with each
succeeding issue, Your story, “A War Anec-
dote,” shows that you have a literary genius in
S: H.'S:

Advocate. Your cuts are poor.

ARGO 127

Mirror. A neat little paper, full of news
and interesting stories. We suggest a few
cuts,

Oracle (M. V. H. S.). Your various de
partments are well edited, but a few more
stories would add much to the appearance of
your paper. “His Lover” is a clever little
story.

Signal. Always interesting. Full of good
bits of news. The several departments are
well written.

Magpie. An excellent paper. Your cuts
deserve much commendation. You also have
@ very good cover.

St. Margaret’s Chronicle. You are a very
interesting paper. We think, however, that if
your paper had plain edges it would make a
much neater appearance.

Hilltop. A good paper throughout. Your
cover design is very appropriate.

A STORY.
(Concluded from page 120.)

The old cattleman drained his glass, for the
steenth time, and ambled slowly off. Needless
to say, I did go, and in truth it was a hand-
some horse, coal black, with fine, long hair.

There, I have done it. I have written a
story, and | ask your forbearance, “gentle
readers” (that’s an expression always used by
authors) if this tale has been dry. Of course,
as originally told it sounded better, and was
profusely punctuated with drinks furnished by
myself from the Red Ball saloon opposite. All
of which, with his strong language and inter-
jections, I leave out for politeness’s sake. This
is merely to show that the story was not dry
originally, though it may be now. And now,
with thanks for your kind attention, 1 will
bow myself off the stage, begging you to give
me the bouquets, if there are any, now, and
reserve the cabbage and eggs till I am safely

in the wings.

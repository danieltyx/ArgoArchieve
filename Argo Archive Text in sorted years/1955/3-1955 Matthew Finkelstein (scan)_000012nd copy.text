Last Week Cut
From Schedule
Shortens Term

At this time of the year, as every
year, the thoughts of both faculty and
students begin to turn to commence-
ment. This year, Rutgers Prep will be
holding its 189th commencement in a
Series which began in the year 1766.

It has been announced that this June,
commencement will take place one week
earlier than expected. The new date
has been set for June 9.

Final exams, therefore, have also been
rescheduled. They are now due to begin
on May 31, the Tuesday following
Memorial Day. The schedule has been
changed by the Headmaster of the
school because of the Bankers’ Conven-
tion which takes place the same time
as the school’s 189th commencement.

This year’s graduation is awaited and
longed for by both seniors and under-
classmen, and both have promised to
make it as successful as possible. Under
the fine help and supervision of the
faculty, who will continuously give ad-
vice to the students, this year’s com-
mencement can not help being one
of the best in the long history of the
Prep school.

Prepsters See Opera “Faust”

On Student Program At Met
by Dave Hendler

On Friday, March 18, forty Prep
students attended the Metropolitan
Opera. The opportunity is offered to
our school each year by the Metropol-
itan Opera Guild to familiarize high
school students with the beauty of
grand opera.

This year we attended a special per-
formance of Faust, a famous opera
written by Charles Gounod. Faust is a
tragic love story. based on the idea of
selling one’s soul to the devil. Although
no one could understand what was be-
ing sung, the basic idea of the story
was made clear through the acting and
through the libretto prepared by Mr.
Dumarae.

‘The opera proved to be a great hit
with the students. The scenery and
the grandeur of the opera house along
with the music seemed to take the
breath away from all of us.

Teen-age Band Adds Life
To Prep Party And Dance

A party-dance was held on Saturday evening, March 12,

in the Rutgers

Preparatory School Gymnasium. The party was attended by an astonishing
number of students and their friends from other schools. A very good band,
a group of high school students, played the right type of music to suit
everyone.

Prepsters Enjoy Band.

 

Play Practice Begins
For Prep Production

The Rutgers Prep Dramatics Group
is rehearsing for its annual play which
is to be held on May 6th. This is the
second dramatic venture for the school,
following a tradition initiated last year.
The group will be under the direction
of Mr. Dumarae.

After careful consideration as to ease
of production and suitability for a high
school cast, Time Out For Ginger was
selected.

A tentative cast was chosen by Mr.
Dumarae. The cast includes Florence
Schmitt, Sharon Ries, Marion Thomp-
son, Louise DiLalo, Diane Dorn, Howard
Tobin, Noreen Hudson, Clemmie Vitti,
Estelle Newman, Jack Kelly, Gabe Pi-
tacciato, Steve Hancox, Carl Stover,
Pete Schwartz, Vic Stilwell, and John
Bodnar.

The stage crew will be headed by Mr.
Moffat.

This year we will charge admission
for the play, $1.00 for adults and $.50
for children, Students with their I. D.
cards will be admitted to the play free
of charge.

 

The band was a five piece jazz team
composed of Jon Clayton, leader, on
the saxophone and Pene Lypeipfski
also on the sax. Frankie Pedkeira played
trumpet and Douglas Doeich and Steve
Frechan played piano and drums res-
pectively. Everyone enjoyed the music
and many compliments were given the
musicians.

An entirely new twist was added to

= | this dance by the use of tables for many

different table games, including scrab-
ble, card games, and parchesi.

The younger students gathered at
these game tables and became acquaint-
ed with one another easily.

Refreshments consisted of an enor-
mous amount of sandwiches, punch,
cupcakes, and other party-like food-
stuffs, made for the evening by Estelle
Newman and her epicurean staff.

Perhaps the highlight of the evening
was a novelty in the form of a balloon
drop. This new idea proved most suc-
cessful and delightful. As the shower of
balloons hit the floor, many jovial
Prepsters, full of party spirit, added to
the fun by breaking them.

Prep Plans New Style Prom
As Traditional Spring Event

This year, as in previous years, the
Rutgers Preparatory School will have
a senior prom. The tentative date of
May 20th has been chosen for this
event.

Unlike other schools, Prep does not
have a Senior Prom attended only by
Seniors. Any underclassman may attend
this formal event.

It is the custom at Prep that the
junior class run the senior prom. The
following juniors have been chosen for
the committee: Clemmie Vitti, Carl
Baratta, Gail Duschock, Marian Veale
and Ted Kalli.

Stu Edelberg, the president of the
student council, informed the committee
that this year approximately $500.00
will be spent on the prom.

Campaigns Coming!

Only a short time ago constitutional
amendments were voted on by the
student body after being passed by the
Student Council. The new additions
were all passed by a huge majority vote.

However, this unanimous approval
will be of no use whatsoever unless you,
the students of Rutgers Prep, see that
they do function this year and in years
to follow. The amendments concerned
themselves chiefly with the holding of
Student Council Officer elections in
May.

The council cannot pick the candi-
dates nor see that there are candidates
running.

This problem lies chiefly in the pres-
ent Junior class. Thought should be
given to the question of candidates and
party organization. The amendments
offer little restriction on the time when
campaigning may begin, and an early
and avid campaign by any party should
prove most advantageous in this elec-
tion.

Please Return...

Certain books in Mr. Holley’s room
are missing. No one else in the school
needs these books except the U.S.
History class. This has put the class
in an extremely embarrassing position,
and if the people who have the books
would kindly return them it would be
much appreciated by all.

Letters to the Editor

School Spirit. . .

Dear Editor:

I don’t think there is enough school
spirit represented at school functions.
All through basketball season, games
were played after school and at night.
These should have had at least some
turn-out. There were free busses for
every game so there could be no possible
excuse. Every school function is treated
the same way.

Take, for instance, the school dances.
They are always a flop and only because
the big shots of the school will not
lower themselves to come. If there were
a representation of the upper classmen,
the dances would be a success, but, of
course, that’s asking too much. Coming
up next is baseball season. Let's see
if some kids can forget their spring
fever and come to at least one of the
games.

“Determined”

Chapel Service .. .

Dear Editor:

I think it would improve our Chapel
Service if there was some variation in
the hymns we sing each week. At pres-
ent there are only three hymns which
are usually sung. These are nice hymns
but their constant use has, I am sure,
made everyone wish for a change. I
know I do. Probably anyone at Prep
could sing these three backwards!

Each week we sing one patriotic song,
which is always America. Surely every
student at Prep must know the Star
Spangled Banner and America the
Beautiful. The latter would offer a
pleasant change.

I think all of us at Prep would enjoy
Chapel Service more if we had a wider
selection in the songs we sing.

Hopefully yours,
Florence Schmitt.

 

 

Vitti’s Reply ...
Dear Miss Schmitt:

Your point in your letter is very well-
taken, but it is perhaps necessary to
supply you with some exact information.

It is most difficult to choose new
hymns each week which are suited to
the various faiths of the students. On
the other hand, with a new set of hymn
books, this might be done. It seems as
though one hundred of these books
would be rather costly and rather un-
necessary. As for the patriotic songs,
which are not in the hymnal, they
would only tend to produce a mediocre
service. Therefore,
have been tried, and unsuccessfully so,

I would suggest leaving the service as

it stands.
Sincerely,

since new hymns

SPOR TLIGHT

by Andy Piscatelli

Due to the expert coaching of Coach
O'Connell and the consistent ability of
his boys, this year’s basketball team had
one of the finest records in the history
of Prep.

The success of the team was largely
due to Jerry Gorczyca’s tremendous

ring and his ability to control the
packboards. Much credit goes to Gary
Stratton, our center. Gary, an up-and-
coming ball player, improved through
the season in his rebounding and scor-
img habits. Our left forward, Bob Sho-
rosky, kept the team well-balanced with
his deadly one-hander which he man-
aged to throw in when it was needed
the most.

The team was rounded out by our
two back-court men, Roger Lambert-
son and Captain Roger Seamon. These
two boys handled the ball like profes-
sionals, always trying to pass it to the
side men.

Lambertson and Seamon were known
for their fast break in which both
scored a number of points, helping the
team immensely. This vital play was
taught to them by our coach.

Great credit goes to the second five,
Stan Rosenblum, who added a lot of
hustle and scrap, Chuck Martorelli, Bert
Sathmary, Mike Harrington, and Andy

Piscatelli.

Bob Shorosky Stars In Last Game.

Prepsters Display Enthusiasm

As Baseball Season Arrives
by Carl Baratta

When spring sports are mentioned,
the first thing that comes into most
boys’ minds is baseball. Prep will have
a baseball team this year as usual.

There will be four returning letter-
men to this year’s squad. They are:
Stuart Edelberg, who patrols center-
field with great authority; Stan Rosen-
blum, Prep’s starting catcher last year;
Carl Baratta; and Joe Messina. Besides
these four, there will also be letter
winners from other schools trying out
at their respective positions. They are:
Ray Koperwhats from Perth Amboy;
Jerry Gorezyca from St. Mary’s of
South Amboy; Bob Shorosky from
Sayreville; Joe Eichhorn from Highland
Park; Roger Lambertson and Gary
Stratton from Hoffman; and Bert
Sathmary from Perth Amboy.

As a result of the size of the school
and of the failure to produce a good
track team in the past, there will not
be any track at Prep this year. Mr.
O'Connell decided that in its place
there should be a J.V. baseball team.
This should prove to be a success.

On March 5, Pingry School of Eliza-
beth gained its second straight Group
II Championship by defeating Prep.
The score at the end of the fourth can-

Busch, Pingry’s

1] to stood at 72-60.

big

Herb (Twig)

center, was the deciding factor in the

game. The big six foot seven star put
in 46 points for Pingry to make victory

certain.
Bush Averages 34 Points
For the last six games, Busch has

-}| managed to dump in 206 points for a
‘| game average of better than 34 points.

The only victory for Prep out of those
six games was won on January 11th of
this year, when the Prepsters squeezed
through with a four point lead.

Pingry, under the onslaught of the
“Twig,” jumped to an early lead in the
first quarter gaining a 12 point lead.
Busch dumped in 10 more points in the
second quarter. In this period, however,
the Prepsters, with the help of Bob
Shorosky and Gary Stratton, scored 13
more points than Pingry, giving them
a one point lead at the half.

Prepsters Tie

The score was tied midway through
the third quarter at 40-40 and changed
three times before Busch finally put
Pingry ahead with two field goals. From
here on in, Pingry had an open road,
and Prep couldn’t seem to close the gap.
Prep’s inability to stop Busch in the
fourth quarter really proved to be a
disaster. The big center rimmed 20
points in the final eight minutes of
play to put the game on the ice for
Pingry. The last two minutes proved
bad for Prep as Bob Shorosky fouled
out.

‘ROUND ABOUT RUTGERS
by SHARON RIES

The Argo staff is very glad to see Mr.
Holley back on his feet and we hope
he feels fine. We would also like to
thank Mr. John Cunningham for tak-
ing over some of his classes.

We are very proud that a number of
our boys have already been accepted
at colleges. These are: Lawerence Mur-
ray, at the University of Maryland;
Roger Lambertson at both Rutgers and
Brown; Stu Edelberg at Cornell and
Rennsalaer; Roger Seamon at Cornell;
and Barry Brodsky at Saint Lawerence
University.

Several students from local high
schools “crashed” the school party Sat-
urday night. Since they were uninvited
guests, they soon left.

There have been quite a few com-
plaints around Prep about the fortune
spent on books in the Humanities class
lately.

Many of the teachers have noticed
that almost everyone's marks have been
going down this marking period. Let’s
get to work.

There's great furore at Prep about
the Presidential elections in May. Cam-
paigns start soon and perhaps our next
president will be a woman.

Group Attends ACO Concert

As part of Mr. Dumarae’s attempt to
instill a bit of culture in his Humani-

concert in a series at the Rutgers Uni-
versity gym. On Thursday evening,
March 10, the class and a few guests
listened to music by the American
Chamber Orchestra under Robert
Schulz.

Featured on the program was the
violin soloist, Joseph Szigeti, who played
the 4th and 5th violin concertos of Mo-
zart.

The evening opened with The Over-
ture to Ester by Handel. This was foll-
owed by the violin solos. The orchestra
completed the program with Schubert's
5th symphony.

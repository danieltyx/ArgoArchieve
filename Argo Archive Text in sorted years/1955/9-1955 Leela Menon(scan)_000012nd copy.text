Warm Welcome

I am very proud to welcome each
one of you to our 190th school year.
My feelings ef pride come from being
bble to offer you a reconditioned anu
improved building in which to study,
from being able to offer small classes
in which to study together, from our
fine faculty, and mostly from the fine
potential which you students possess.

Each one of you has the opportunity
so rare these days of developing your
abilities and skills as individuals under
the guidance of experienced teachers.
I sincerely hope that you will be proud
of our school, of your classmates anu ©
yourself as you take advantage of t.u
Opportunities we offer you.

Students Get Set
For Fall Evaluation

During October 16-20 several repre-
sentatives from the betterknown higu
schools and prep schools in this area
will make daily appearances in tue
school as a part of an evaluation proc-
ess. These men will take an active
part in the functioning of school life
in general.

During the closing months of schoo)
Jast year, the Student Council was
presented with a booklet to be used
as an integral part of this evaluations
process, This booklet, labeled Pupil
Activity Program, covers in its con-
tents every phase of school life from
academic to social. On the basis of
the facts therein plus what the visiting
group will witness, the-schoo] will be
evaluated, Therefore, much hinges on
the type of information set up by this
group and last year's council.

Through this process, the good and
the bad, the weak and the strong
points of the school can be easily de-
termined.

Prep Adds Teacher
To Present Faculty

This year Prep will welcome one
additional teacher to its staff. Mrs.
Robert M. Frisch, who was contracted
by Mr. Heinlein to teach several eighth
grade classes, will also act as guidance
director for the eighth grade. During
her homeroom period once a day, Mrs.
Frisch will help the eighth graders
improve their study habits and tech-
niques.

A native of Florida, Mrs. Frisch had
previously taught in Sanford Junior
High School there before coming to
New Brunswick. She is a graduate of
Duke University where she majored in
psychology and sociology. Mrs, Frisch
and her husband live at 22 Redcliffe
Avenue in Highland Park. Mr. Frisch,
who is also a graduate of Duke, is a
lawyer and is employed in the office
of Judge George R. Morrison,

In addition to her other duties, our
new faculty member will help Mr,
Gaggini with YE DIAL. By checking
all articles for the yearbook to see
that they are properly written, typed
and proofread, Mrs. Frisch will be a
tremendous help to the yearbook stati
and Mr. Gaggini will have more time
for the managing and business end
of YE DIAL.

3rd. Floor

To Accomodate Students

summer many changes and improve-
ments were made.

The conversion of part of the third
floor into two classrooms is probably
the most important change. One of
these will be used as the eighth grado
homeroom and classroom. The other
will be used by Mr. Gaggini for French
and Spanish. This new room will en-
able full use of the recording equip-
ment given to the school last year by
the Student Council. The old foreign
language room will be used for publi-
cation and various club meetings. To
provide heat for these rooms the chim-
ney had to be enlarged.

The lower floor has also been re-
finished with a new coat of paint. Here
you will find a pleasing pale green
replacing the drab color we used to
see. pal
The school authorities have also
ziven some attention to our safety. A
completely new iron staircase will pro-
vide safe exits from all floors im case
of fire.

This “new look” has extended to our
gym as well. The gym floor and panel-
ling have been refinished and the walls
have been cleaned. The locker rooms
have been renovated too; there’s new
paint on the walls, This new look is
a welcome change at Prep!

School Plans Grading System
To The Students’ Advantage

Those students who were here last
year will remember that Prep’s grading
system was changed from the much
used letter method to the more mean-
ingful numerical system. This year,
two additional changes to the grading
system have been made.

Instead of Prep’s usual six report
cards per year, four reports will be
received, one every eight weeks. In
addition, the second semester will be
worth two thirds of the entire year’s
grade or just twice as much as the
first semester. Mr, Heinlein and the
faculty have made the latter change to

 

| Prevent the Spring slump which occurs
jall too often. This change should also
| be beneficial to new students who need
time to adjust to their new surroun-
|dings and methods of teaching.

From The
Editor’s Desk

In about two weeks elections for
representatives to the Student Council
will take place here at Prep. Since the
officers of the Council were elected
last year, only the class representatives
need to be elected. The importance of
this election cannot be overstressed
Each representative should be carefully
chosen because a class can only be

what the class representatives make
it.

Class functions are very important
to every individual. Only your repre-
sentatives can enable you to have any
sort of class activities. If he is incap-
able of his duties, then only the clas:
itself will suffer.

Each class should have at least one
outing or party. Popularity will noi
help your representative in gaining suck
privileges. He must be aggressive, hon-
est and capable of holding a position
on the Stucent Council. So when you
vote in two weeks, vote wisely. Remem-
ber, a Student Council is only what
you make it. If it {s not up to par,
there is no one to blame but yourself.

Barbecue Headlines
Prep Social Season

Following a precedent set up by last
year’s Student Council, another out-
door barbecue will be held on Sept. 25

Last fall this affair served as a
gathering place for future friends to
meet. Students have little chance to
meet each other during the opening
weeks of school. In veiw of this, a
gathering of this type serves as an
excellent opportunity for students to
get together and function both as
classmates and friends.

The barbecue itself will be held on
the court which is aside the Rutgers
Prep Gym. Frankfurters and hamburg-
ers and other outdoor food will head-
line the menu.

Both new and old students alik«
should benefit from such an outing.
The main purpose of the affair is to
enable every one of you to get to know
each other.

Don’t be hesitant— come out— meet
friends.

| SPORTLIGHT

by Carl Baratta

Well, here I am, and there you are,
and here’s the sport: Soccer. In a few
weeks the Prep boys will be giving all
tney have on that 120 yard stretch
of soccer field. About this time of year
we begin to wonder what kind of team
will be representing Prep in the fail
sport.

Your old Sportlighter is on top again
with some hot tips on the subject. As
usual, the team will be piloted by our
eificient Coach and biology teacher,
Mr. O'Connell. This year, judging from
the material, I would say that Coach
will be working with a fine team.
There will be three returning letter-
men from last year’s starting lineup.

 

First there is Stan Rosenblum who

came to Prep two years ago, boasting

an excellent record as a goalie. Anoth-

ex returning letterman is Joe Messina.
Joe broke into the starting lineup as
a freshman and has stuck ever since.
A great hustler, Joe was tagged with
the name “Spaghetti Bender” by the
Coach in his freshman year, The final
returning letterman is myself. I don’t
snow whether I have helped or hin-
ered the team so I think we'll skip
my record.

Even with these three returning
lettermen, Prep will need eleven good
players to have a good soccer team.
Any boy wanting to go out for the
sport will be very welcome. Knowledge
of the sport is not necessary .. . come
vn out... you won't regret it,

I have been approached a number
of times by a few alumni of Rutgers
Prep, It seems that they think that
the alumni can whip the regulars if
we had an alumni game. How about it,
Coach?

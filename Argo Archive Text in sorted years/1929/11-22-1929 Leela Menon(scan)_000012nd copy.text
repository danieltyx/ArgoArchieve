The football se n is all over

been a very successful one, too,

from all points of view. As for the |

scores, the ma

every respect. Averaging the play-
ing on the other hand, we think
that Prep has far outplayed its
opponents in almost every game

easily beat that first opposing

The games that we tied were
both hard-fought, thrilling battles,
but no opportunity presented it-
self to the Prep team to make the
necessary winning score. Tie games
are always the most interesting of
all, anyway, as those who saw the

Prepsters look good. All in all, it
has surely been a successful season

Hennig Shows Skill

Concerning the team itself, how-
ever, and the players, it has been
even more successful. Coach Hen-
nig has built up a well organized
machine from a bunch of good,
though Individually different men.
The majority of the players this
year are new to the school and its
methods. They come from schools
all around, where they played In
entirely different ways, or perhaps
did not play at all. There was no
firm, stable foundation left from
last year on which to build, Each
man had to be carefully singled
out, put in the place he filled best,
and the whole team thus drilled
together. Thus in the short perlod
of two months, our team this year
was made and made well. The way
they have been improving with

more.

It was about to explode when
he realized the danger to others,
and so falling upon the grenade
he saved his comrades from the
blast. Had he not done this there
would probably have been a dozen
killed and injured.

Fought In Argonne

Later Captain Reed's regiment
was assigned to the Argonne For-
est, where the men could scarcely
creep through the dense under-
brush so thick was it. At one time,
a platoon in which Captain Reed
was fighting was on a hill behind
the enemy lings. To keep out of
the sight of thy gunners, each sol-

 

 

lines. When Cs eptain Reed report-
ed to his super or officer, the lat-
ter, doubting the truth of the
stoi came over with his spy
glasses, and when he was assured,
of the position of the platoon, stood
up on the ridge to look with his
spy glass. Of course, the enemy
gunners saw him, and immediate-
ly shells were bursting everywhere
thereabouts.

Officer Finds Cov

The officer himself jumped into
a hole dug by one of the soldiers,
head first in his great haste to
reach safety. Therafter the place
was shelled every afternoon for
about three hours,

Previously, they had captured a
sroup of Germans armed with ¢
shovels, who had been sent up to
occupy the hill, Not long afterward,
the Germans were driven from the

 

 

vicinity. Captain Reed
was shot on November 1, and was
sull in the hospital when the

Armistice was signed, In closing,
Captain Reed stated that, although
the w had its many funny epl-
sodes, it was a futile and horrible
game, which in the long run, bene-
fited no one, He pressed his
hope that none of the people of
future generations would ever have

to really help children who are leet

year, and he deserves all of the

He is a great in. great foot-

Two of the other hard-fighting men
were Bill Shann and Fletcher
Breeden. They went through the

jal they could to uphold Prep's

too, deserve a lot of credit for their

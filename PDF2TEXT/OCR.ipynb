    "You are correct that the OCR process typically reads from left to right and may not be able to properly recognize text in separate columns of a newspaper. Here are a few suggestions for how you can modify the OCR process to better handle multi-column text in a newspaper:\n",
    "\n",
    "Split the image into separate columns: One option is to split the image into separate columns and perform OCR on each column individually. You can use image processing techniques such as edge detection or thresholding to detect the column boundaries and then split the image into separate images for each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use OCR software that is designed for multi-column text: Some OCR software, such as ABBYY FlexiCapture, is specifically designed to handle multi-column text and may provide better results in this case. You can try using one of these specialized OCR tools instead of pytesseract.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a custom OCR model: Another option is to train a custom OCR model using machine learning techniques. You can use a dataset of scanned newspaper images with corresponding transcriptions to train a model that is able to recognize multi-column text. This approach requires a more in-depth understanding of machine learning and OCR, but it may provide the best results for your specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope these suggestions help! Let me know if you have any further questions."
